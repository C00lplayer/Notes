Week 1

*   Control flow:
    
    *   **Repetition:**(repeating a sequence of statements by making a 'loop') is a form of **control flow**: you are _controlling_ the _flow_ of your program.
    
    *   **Sequence** (following one statement after another, in order) is another form of control flow. Actually, it's the simplest flow you can have.
    
    *   **Branching**: where the code which is executed can change each time our program is run depending on certain conditions.
    
    *   **Abstraction:** This is a kind of programming control flow which takes a group of code blocks which has some purpose and gives it a name, so that we can use it again and again without thinking about the individual instructions every time we do.

*   The number of times around the loop is the number of **iterations**

*   Putting loops inside other loops is called **nesting the statement/nested loop**

### Summary:

*   We learned how to read slides, build simple Blockly programs and submit them for testing, and about how the number of green diamonds you have collected will determine your mark for each module.

*   We learned how programs are built by connecting a **sequence** of simple 'building blocks' (statements), and that programs are run by following these statements one at a time.

*   We learned how to use **repetition** to make a program follow a sequence of statements over and over again, a fixed number of times.

*   We learned how to use **branching** to direct a program's flow between alternative sequences of statements.

*   We learned how to **take input** from the user which could be used in conditions to direct the program's flow dynamically.

*   We learned how to **nest** control flow statements together to make more complex programs.

*   We learned how to use **abstraction** to create functions which we could call by name whenever we wanted to.

*   We learned how **arguments** make functions work in different ways, because they allow for a value to be given as input to a function when it is called.
