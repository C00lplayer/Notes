Worksheet 2: Numerical Expressions
==================================

**Date:** March 3, 2024

**Subject:** COMP10001

Expressions and Data Types:
---------------------------

*   Two important structural terms for code are **statements** and **expressions**. These form the structure of each and every program.

*   A **statement** is any valid line of Python code. Think of it like a sentence in a book

*   An **expression** is, as a simplified definition, a statement which **evaluates** to some value
    
    *   All code involving numerical operators which we have seen so far are expressions, since they evaluate to the solution of the mathematical operation they're performing. 
    
    *   `9 + 11` and `3.0 / 4` are expressions.
    
    *   `input("Enter a number: ")` is also an expression as it will evaluate to the string input by the user.
    ```python
    x = 25          # a statement
    x = x + 10      # an expression
    ```

*   All expressions are statements, but not all statements are expressions.
    
    *   Only statements which evaluate to some value are expressions. 
    
    *   `(2 + 3) * (5 - 7)` is both an expression and a statement.

*   A statement can contain multiple expressions, for example `(2 + 3) * (5 - 7)` is a single statement (one line of code) but contains three expressions: one with `+`, one with `-` and one with `*`.

*   Expressions themselves can be made of multiple expressions: again looking at  `(2 + 3) * (5 - 7)`, it is an expression containing three sub-expressions.

*   The most common way we've seen to make some code evaluate to some result is by using an **operator**.

*   Recall that we've looked at four operators so far: `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`.
    *   In an arithmetic sense, they perform a calculation using two numbers, which are written on either side of the operator. These numbers are known as **operands**.

*   A **simple expression** is an expression containing one operator and its operands.

*   Because simple expressions return a value, they could be used to construct more expressions, such as `(3 + 5) / (4 - 2)`.
    
    *   The two operands of `/` are simple expressions whose result will be used to calculate the division.
    
    *   But an expression with expressions inside it is no longer a simple expression, but rather a **compound** expression.
    
    *   You could continue to replace numbers by expressions infinitely, making even more complicated expressions!

*   To allow operators to behave differently when used with different types of data, Python gives a **data type** to every value we store

*   Data types include:

| **Type** | **Description**|
|----------|----------------|
|`int`     |For whole numbers eg: `-3`, `-5`, or `10`|
|`float`|For real numbers eg: `-3.0`, `0.5`, or `3.14159`|
|`bool`|The Boolean type. For storing `True` and `False` (only those two values; Booleans allow for no grey areas!).|
|`str` (= "string")|For chunks of text, e.g.: `"Hello, I study Python"`|
|`tuple`|For combinations of objects, e.g.: `(1, 2, 3)` or `(1.0, "hello", "frank")`|
|`list`|A more powerful way of storing lists of objects, e.g. `[1, 3, 4]` or `[1.0, "hello", "frank"]`|
|`dict`|A way to store a **value** with a **key**,  `{"bob": 34, "frankenstein": 203}`|

*   Note that you can check the data type of any object with the `type` function. e.g:
```python
    print(type("Can you make this print:"))
```
* Which outputs: `<class 'str'>` which shows the data type being ‘str’ also known as string

Integers and Floats:
--------------------

*   The data type `int` is a type for all positive and negative whole numbers (yes, and zero; i.e. all integers), such as ­`1` or `-1523`

> [!TIP]
> Python allows for underscores to be used inside numbers, acting like commas to make them easier to read.
> The huge number `300000000000000000` in the print statement above might be hard to interpret, but we can instead write it as `300_000_000_000_000_000` which hopefully makes it a _little_ more clear to see that it's 300 quadrillion!
> This is purely a visual aid for numbers which you write into python programs: when they are printed out, they don't have the underscores. The following two lines of code are equivalent:

*   The type `int` is distinct from the type `float`, which represents numbers with a decimal component such as ­`9.23`. These number are called **floating point numbers** and can approximate fractions

*   If a number has a decimal place, Python will interpret it as a `float`.

*   Another way of creating a `float` is scientific notation, e.g. `1e3`. The notation `1e3` is just a shorthand for 1\* 10^3:

*   If an integer is added/subtracted/multiplied to another integer is results in a variable with an integer data type

*   But if two integers are divided the resulting variable will be a variable with a data type of float

*   However if the operands are integers with a decimal point, each operand and the result becomes a float

*   This can be summarised in a table:

|**Expression**|**Result**|
|--------------|----------|
|`int` (`*`,`+`,`-`)  `int`|`int`|
|`int` `/` `int`|`float`|
|`float` (`*`,`+`,`-`,`/`) `float`|`float`|
|`float` (`*`,`+`,`-`,`/`) `int`|`float`|
|`int` (`*`,`+`,-,`/`) `float`|`float`|

*   A **rounding error** is the discrepancy between the approximated value and its exact value.

*   Floating point numbers allow us to represent a large set of numbers. Since there are infinitely many numbers (even in the range of -1 to 1) and the `float` data type has only a fixed amount of computer storage space available, some numbers will inevitably have rounding errors.

### Integers and Floats Summary:

*   **Statements** are the building blocks of a program. Every valid line of Python code is a statement.

*   **Expressions** are statements which evaluate to some value. They could be literal values or the mathematical operations or an instance the `input()` function.

*   A **simple expression** is an expression composed of an **operator** and its **operands** (generally two).

*   Each value in Python has an associated **data type** which defines the kind of information it stores.

We formally introduced two data types (in addition to `str` which we saw previously):

*   The `int` data type represents all positive and negative **integers** (whole numbers).

*   The `float` data type represents all **floating point numbers** which are those which contain a fractional part.

*   `float`s can be created by writing a number with a decimal point or by using the `e` scientific notation.

*   `float`s are approximations, and **rounding error** discrepancies are common when dealing with precise numbers.

We looked at which data types the basic operations return:

*   When the operands of addition, subtraction or multiplication are both `int`s, the result will always be an `int`.

*   When at least one operand of `+`,  or  is a `float`, the result will always be a `float`.

*   When using division, the result will always be a `float` regardless of whether the operands are `int`s or `float`s.

Type Conversions and Inputs:
----------------------------

*   Python provides an explicit means of converting one data type into another data type (if the conversion is possible). This conversion is also called **type casting**
    *   The function `int()` converts floating point numbers to integer values. It can also convert strings if all

*   Note that the conversion from a floating point number to an integer always truncates the fractional part, meaning that `32.0`, `32.5` and `32.999` all convert to `32`

*   However if you try to convert between data types when the conversion is not possible it fails
    *   Like the example below you cannot convert between the string type to integer type as the string contains the decimal point which is not a digit:
```python
    print(int("32.7"))
```
*   The `float()` function returns the corresponding `float` value for the input:
```python
    print(float(32))
```
*   `float()` is able to convert any string representation of an integer or floating point number into a `float`, including numbers written with scientific notation. This is an improvement over `int()` which could only convert strings containing digits.
    *   The following will all be successful in converting to float type:
```python
    print(float("32.7"))
    print(float("32e4"))
    print(float("32"))
```
*   The function `str()` converts values to the type `str` (a string).

> [!TIP]
> To convert to a particular type, you just have to use the function with the same name as that type. This is consistent with all types, from `int()` all the way to `dict()` and `set()`

*   `input()` always returns a string, so if your program requires a string as input, there is nothing more to do

*   If the input is a number, on the other hand, Python will see this as a string consisting of digits

*   We need a function that converts a string where each character is a digit, into a number. If your program expects integer values, you simply use the function `int()`:
```python
    num = int(input('Enter a number to double: '))
    print('2 x', num, '=', 2 * num)
```
*   If your program expects floating point numbers, you would cast to a  `float`  using  `float()` instead.

More Operators:
---------------

*   You saw previously that the division operator `/` returns a `float` when applied to two integers.

*   However, there are instances where you want to rely on the result of a division being an integer, irrespective of the numbers involved.

*   This is called the **integer division** or **floor division** operator and in Python it is used with a double slash `//`, as seen in this example:
    ```python
        print(13 // 4)
    ```
    *   which outputs `3`

*   Note that in integer division, the result is always rounded down to the nearest integer

*   However, if we divide thirteen people into three groups of four, there will be one person left over. The **modulo operator** `%` computes the **remainder** of an integer division. Here is an example of using modulo to calculate remainders:
    ```python
        # Using the modulus operator
        print(13 % 4)
    ```
    *   Outputs `1`

*   Finally, to raise things to powers in Python (e.g. 47), we use the **exponentiation operator** `**`

*   Following the order of operations, exponentiation operations are performed _before_ any addition or subtraction operations.
    *   Also note how the exponentiation operator is generally used with no whitespace between the two numbers it applies to, unlike all other arithmetic operators:
```python
    print(2**2)
    print(3**2)
```
### Type Conversions and Operator Summary:

*   **Type casting** is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.

*   Casting can be achieved by using the type's name as a function. For example, `int()` converts the value inside brackets into an integer.

*   The `input()` function always returns a string, so casting is a useful way to convert input text into your preferred type.

Some new arithmetic operators were introduced:

*   The `//` **integer division** or **floor division** operator performs division but returns the result as an `int` by truncating the fractional part.

*   The `%` **modulo** operator returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second.

*   The `*` **exponentiation** operator returns the value of the first operand raised to the power of the second.
