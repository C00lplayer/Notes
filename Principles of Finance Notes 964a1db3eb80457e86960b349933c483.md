# Topic 1: An overview of Principles of Finance and an Introduction to Financial Mathematics

## What is Finance?

- Finance is the study of how individuals, businesses and institutions acquire, spend and manage financial resources
- Finance is forward looking compared to the backward looking of accounting
    - It is also more cash focused

### Listed Corporations and Legal Forms of Business

- This subject focuses on listed corporations
- A Listed Corporation is:
    - A legal entity separate from the owners
    - The ownership of the corporation is represented by a share of stocks
        - Shares are created via an IPO or a placement
    - Corporations have two sources of cash:
        - Debt → Which is borrowing funds
        - Equity → Which is get funds from owners (shareholders) by issuing shares
    - Board of Directions of a corporation monitor the role of management and set the strategy of the company
    - The CEO and CFO sit below the board and implement the strategy set out by the boards
- There are also other forms of legal business like:
    - Sole Proprietorships:
        - A sole proprietorship is a business with a single owner. In fact, in sole proprietorships, there is no legal distinction between the business and the owner.
        - The business is the owner’s personal property; it exists only as long as the owner lives and chooses to operate it, and all business assets belong to the owner. Furthermore, the owner bears personal liability for all the company’s debts and pays income taxes on its earnings.
        - However, this organisational form suffers from weaknesses that in most cases limit the company’s long-term growth potential. These include the following:
            - Limited life – By definition, a proprietorship ceases to exist when the founder retires or dies
            - Limited access to capital – A proprietorship can obtain operating capital from only two sources: reinvested profits and personal borrowing by the entrepreneur. In practice, both of these sources are easily exhausted.
            - Unlimited personal liability – A sole proprietor is personally liable for all the debts of the business, including judgements awarded to a plaintiff in any successful lawsuit. This is a high risk, which often is not insurable; and the risk is not spread widely because the sole proprietor has a small investment by definition
    - Partnerships:
        - A (general) **partnership** is essentially a proprietorship with two or more owners who have joined their skills and personal wealth.
        - As in a sole proprietorship, there is no legal distinction between the business and its owners, each of whom can execute contracts binding on all the other(s), and each of whom is personally liable for all the partnership’s debts.
            - This sharing of legal responsibility is known as **joint and several liability**
        - The drawbacks of the partnership form resemble those of the sole proprietorship
    - Limited Partnerships
        - **Limited partnership (LP):** A partnership in which most of the participants (the limited partners) have the limited liability of corporate shareholders, but their share of the profits from the business is taxed as partnership income
        - In any limited partnership, there must be one or more general partners, each of whom has unlimited personal liability.
            - Because only the general partners operate the business and are legally exposed, they usually receive a greater-than-proportional (in terms of their capital contribution) share of partnership income.
        - Most of the participants in the partnership are limited partners.
            - They have the limited liability of corporate shareholders, but their share of the profits from the business is taxed as partnership income.
        - The limited partners, however, must be totally passive. They contribute capital to the partnership, but cannot have their names associated with the business; nor can they take an active role in the operation of the business, even as employees.
        - In return for this passivity, the limited partners face no personal liability for business debts. This means that although limited partners can lose their equity investment in the business, tax authorities (or other plaintiffs) cannot sue the limited partners personally for payment of their claims.
        - Limited partnerships are ideal vehicles for funding long-term investments that generate large non-cash operating losses in the early years of the business because these losses flow through directly to the limited partners. This means the limited partners can (under specified conditions) use the tax losses to offset taxable income from other sources
    - Proprietary Limited Companies
        - A private company is a more complex business structure formed by one or more people who wish to have a business that is a separate legal entity to themselves. This makes a key distinction with the concepts of partnerships and sole proprietor forms of organisation.
        - A proprietary limited company creates the roles of employee, director and shareholder of the company.
        - Establishment and ongoing administrative costs associated with such companies can be high, which is why the structure is generally considered to be better suited for medium to large businesses
    - Companies
        - Under corporations laws in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and many other nations with British-style laws, a **company** is defined as a fictitious person created by charter, prescription or legislation.
        - It is also called a corporation. Because it is a ‘person’ separate from humans, a company is owned by the shareholders, who hold its ordinary shares, with many of the economic rights and responsibilities enjoyed by individuals. A company can sue and be sued, it can own property and execute contracts in its own name, and it can be tried and convicted for crimes committed by its employees
        - The corporate organisational form has several key competitive advantages over other forms, including the following:
            - **Unlimited life** – Once created, a company has perpetual life unless it is explicitly terminated.
            - **Limited liability – The company’s shareholders cannot be held personally liable for the company’s debts**.
            - **Separable contracting** – Companies can contract individually with managers, suppliers, customers and ordinary employees, and each individual contract can be renegotiated, modified or terminated without affecting other stakeholders.
            - **Improved access to capital** – The company itself, rather than its owners, can borrow money from creditors
    - Limited Liability Companies
        - The limited liability company (LLC) combines the tax advantages of a partnership with the limited liability protection of a company. These forms were developed in the US, where they are easy to set up
- 

### Primary vs. Secondary Market

- Primary Market:
    - When a company issues a new financial security to raise funds, this occurs in the primary market
    - Funds raised are obtained by the issuer
    - An IPO (Initial Public Offering) provides an opportunity for the firm to raise funds in the primary market
    - Company issues shares ⇒ the Company raises it’s cash
    - You can also do a private placement in which you raise funds from institutional investors for quick and low-cost cash
- Secondary markets:
    - Where existing financial securities are bought and sold
    - So shares are exchanged but there is no cash flow affect on the company
    - It involves buying and selling of existing financial securities
    - Transfers the ownership of the shares, which allow liquidity to the shareholders
    - While it doesn’t raise funds, it creates a liquid and efficient market in which investors can sell the securities later in the future which positively impacts primary markets

## Four Fundamental Concepts in Finance

### Focus on Cash Flows “Cash is King”

- Finance focus on cash flows and forwards looking
- It seeks to identify and value the (forecast) future benefits and costs of a decision.
- To evaluate these benefits and costs, we need to quantify them on the same terms
- This is due to only cash being able to be reinvested and used in financial consumption

### **The Time Value of Money**

- **Time value of money:** Financial concept that explicitly recognises that $1 received today is worth more than $1 received in the future
    - Thus, the time value of money is a financial concept recognising that the value of a cash receipt (or payment) depends not only on how much money you receive, but also on when you receive it
- If cash flows expected at different times have different values then this implies that there is a time value of money
- This implies that we can’t just add $ together to value assets when their cash flows are expected to occur at different times
- Because of this $100 now than $100 a year from now because:
    - Inflation over time
        - The purchasing power of the $100 decreases over time
    - Opportunity cost ( Rate of return from investing)
        - You will be able to earn more money from investing opportunity during the 1 year
    - Risk of waiting for the $100 in a years time
- This makes arise the following concepts:
    - **Future value:**
        - The value of an investment made today measured at a specific future date, accounting for interest earned over the life of the investment
            - If we had $100 right now and we put it into an investment that pays 5% interest per year, we would say that $105 is the *future value* of $100 invested for one year at 5%.
            - More generally, the future value is the value of a cash receipt or payment as at some future date
    - **Present value:**
        - The value today of a cash flow to be received at a specific date in the
        future, accounting for the opportunity to earn interest at a specified rate
            - We can reframe the above example where you have no money today, but you expect to receive $105 in one year and that a bank is willing to lend you money, charging an interest rate of 5%. How much would they lend you today if you promise to pay them the $105 that you will receive next year?
            - The bank will give you $100 today in exchange for a payment next year of $105. Here, $100 is the *present value* of $105 to be received in one year when the interest rate is 5%.
            - More generally, the present value is just the value of a future cash receipt or payment in terms of today’s dollars

### **Risk and Return**

- Assumption that investors are risk averse
- One way to think about risk is in terms of variability from expected outcomes, the greater is variability of the expected outcome ⇒ the greater the risk of an asset
- People are expected to be compensated because of the risk
- The relationship between risk and expected return is that there are two components
    1. Risk-free rate of return (government rate of bonds)
        
        PLUS
        
    2. Some compensation for the risk that we are exposed to in investment (risk premium)’
- The graph below shows government bonds and other types of bonds
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled.png)
    
    - The gov’t bonds only include the risk-free rate of return
    - While the other A rated and BBB rated bonds inlcude both the risk-free rate of return and the compensation of the risk that we are exposed to in this investment, which is what causes the interest rate to become higher as it is more risky
    - The difference between the gov’t and other bonds normally show the compensation given for investing in the riskier investments

### Firm objective: Maximize Firm Value

- A firms goal is to try and maximize the “value of the firm”
- When a firm is first established, funds are needed to purchase assets
- There are two sources of funds:
    - Debt
    - Equity
- After acquiring assets the firm tries to maximise the value of these assets
    - This is due to maximising value of firm ⇒  maximising the value of assets
- The market value of the firm’s assets (V) at anytime is simply the market value of the firm’s debt (D) plus the market value of the firm’s equity (E)
    
    $$
    𝑉 = 𝐷 + 𝐸
    $$
    
    - The market value of V, D and E are constantly changing
    - This is due to the share price affect E (the market value of the firm’s equity:
        
        $$
        Market \space Capitalisation = \space Share \space price \times \space \#  \space of \space shares
        $$
        
        - The market capitalisation is sometimes equal to E only if shares are the only type of equity
- Shareholders have what’s known as a **residual claim** on the firm’s assets as they stand at the end of the queue:
    - Cash flows generated by firm’s assets
        
        Less:
        
    - Cash paid out in operating expenses
    - Cash paid out to Debtholders
    - Cash paid out to Government for taxes
    - Cash re-invested back into new assets
        
        Equals:
        
    - Cash available to be paid out to shareholders as dividends
- The shareholder value will be maximised when the value of the firm’s assets are maximised
- So managers are employed by the owners of the firms to act as agents of them
- But this can cause issues called Agency Cost, some examples are:
    - **Agency Problems**: The conflict of interest between the goals of a company’s owners and its managers
    - Shareholders can attempt to overcome these agency problems by various means, including:
        - Relying on market forces to exert managerial discipline
        - Incurring the monitoring and bonding costs necessary to ensure that executive compensation packages fairly align the interests of managers and shareholders.
    - Several market forces constrain the behavior of a company’s managers:
        - Institutional investors such as mutual funds, life insurance companies and pension funds, which often hold large blocks of shares and activist institutional investors use their influence to put pressure on underperforming management teams, occasionally applying enough pressure to replace the CEO.
        - Another force is a **hostile takeover**, which involves the acquisition of one company (the target) by another (the acquirer) through an open-market bid for a majority of the target’s shares. Bidders in hostile deals normally replace the incumbent management, so the constant threat of a takeover provides additional motivation for managers to act in the interests of the company’s owners.
            - By definition, a takeover attempt is hostile if the target company’s senior managers resist (or simply do not support) the acquisition

## Financial Maths: Simple versus Compound interest

- Simple Interest:
    - “Simple Interest” is a method of calculating interest payments without reference to any accrued interest to date so it is based on the initial principle
    - We use simple interest to calculate interest for short term securities for a time period less than 1 year
    - Formulas:
        
        $$
        FV_n = PV_0(1+r\times n)
        $$
        
        $$
        PV_0 = \frac{FV_n}{(1+r\times n)}
        $$
        
- Compound Interest:
    - “Compound Interest” is a method of calculating interest payments when interest accrues on both the principal and the accumulated interest
    - Compound interest is used to calculate interest for most long term securities
    - Formulas:
        
        $$
        FV_n = PV \times (1+r)^n
        $$
        
        $$
        PV = \frac{FV_n}{(1+r)^n} = FV_n \times \frac {1}{(1+r)^n}
        $$
        
- NOTE: that in these formulas ‘n’ and ‘r’ are measured in the same basis (years, days,etc.)
    - This means the frequency of compounding (’n’) matches the basis of interest rate (’r’)
    - This is called an effective rate
- If ‘r’ and ‘n’ aren’t measured in the same basis it becomes a stated rate
- The formula for converting stated to effective rates of return is:
    
    $$
    r_e = (1+\frac{r}{m})^m-1
    $$
    
    - Where:
        - $r_e$ is the effective rate of return per period
        - r is the stated rate of return per period compounding each sub-period
        - m is the number of sub-periods per period
- E.g **6% per annum compounding daily:**
    
    $$
    𝑟_𝑒 = (1 + \frac{r}{m})^m− 1 \\
    = (1 + \frac{0.06}{365})^{365} − 1 = 0.061831 = 6.1831 \% \space 𝑝. 𝑎
    $$
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%201.png)
    
- Relationships in the formula:
    - Holding interest rates constant, as the number of periods, n, increases:
        - FV increases
        - PV decreases
    - Holding the number of periods constant, as the interest rate, r, increases:
        - FV increases
        - PV decreases

# Topic 2: An Introduction to Financial Mathematics II

## Using the PV Formula to Solve for Unknown Parameters

- When using the compound interest formula to solve for parameters such as $r$  or $n$ we use the following formula:
    
    $$
    𝑟 = (\frac{𝐹𝑉_𝑛}{𝑃𝑉_0})^{\frac{1}{n}}− 1
    \\
    𝑛 =\frac{l𝑜𝑔(\frac{(𝐹𝑉_𝑛)}{(𝑃𝑉_0)}}{𝑙𝑜𝑔(1+𝑟)} 
    $$
    

## Ordinary Annuities

- An **ordinary annuity** is a series of equal, periodic cash flows ($CF$) occurring at the end of each period and lasting for $n$ periods
    - An important note is that the period of time until receiving cash flow from starting the annuity matches the time period between subsequent periods
- The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity arises from discounting every cash flow until the present, which simplifies to the following:
    
    $$
    𝑃𝑉_0 = \frac{𝐶𝐹}{𝑟}(1 − \frac{1}{(1 + 𝑟)^𝑛})
    $$
    
- Present value of an ordinary annuity can be thought of putting the $PV$  in a savings account that pays  $r\% p.a.$ and then taking out the $CF$ at the end of every period which will mean at the end of $n$ periods the balance will fall to zero
- The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity arises from first finding the present value of the annuity then finding the future value of that lump sum after $n$ years  which simplifies to the following:
    
    $$
    𝐹𝑉_𝑛 = \frac{𝐶𝐹}{𝑟}(1 − \frac{1}{(1+𝑟)^𝑛}) × (1+𝑟)^𝑛
    $$
    

## Annuities Due, Deferred Annuities, and Constant Growth Annuities

### Annuity Due

- An **annuity due** is the same as an ordinary annuity but the payments occur at the beginning of each period
- The formula for the present value of an annuity due arises from two methods:
    1. Separating the cash flows into the first cash flow and the rest which can be thought of an ordinary annuity with $n-1$ periods
    2. Thinking that an annuity due is just an ordinary annuity that starts at 1 year before the present, so we can calculate the present value of this “ordinary annuity” one years before the present and then compound it forward by one year
- So:
    
    $$
    𝑃𝑉_0 = \frac{𝐶𝐹}{𝑟}(1 − \frac{1}{(1+𝑟)^𝑛}) × (1+𝑟) \\ or\\ 𝑃𝑉_0 = 𝐶𝐹 + \frac{𝐶𝐹}{𝑟}(1 − \frac{1}{(1+𝑟)^{𝑛−1}})
    $$
    
- And then like for an ordinary annuity to find the future value we just compound the present value to the end of the annuity which in this case would be $n$ periods:
    
    $$
    F𝑉_n = \frac{𝐶𝐹}{𝑟}(1 − \frac{1}{(1+𝑟)^𝑛}) × (1+𝑟)^{n+1} \\ or\\ F𝑉_n = (𝐶𝐹 + \frac{𝐶𝐹}{𝑟}(1 − \frac{1}{(1+𝑟)^{𝑛−1}}))(1+r)^{n}
    $$
    

### Deferred Annuities

- Just like an ordinary annuity except it has a delayed start
    - Intuitively, it must be worth less than a standard ordinary annuity
- If we define:
    - $t$ as the number of periods until the first cash flow is paid
    - $N$ as the number of cash flows paid (note different to n)
- Then the present value is just the present value of a  $N$ period ordinary annuity which is discounted $t-1$ periods:
    
    $$
    𝑃𝑉_0 = (\frac{𝐶𝐹}{𝑟}(1 − \frac{1}{(1+𝑟)^𝑁}))× \frac{1}{(1 + 𝑟)^{𝑡−1}}
    $$
    

### Constant Growth Annuity

- Just like an ordinary annuity except the cash flows grow at a constant rate of g per period (where r > g)
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%202.png)
    
- The formula for the present value is:
    
    $$
    𝑃𝑉 = \frac{𝐶𝐹}{𝑟−𝑔} (1 − (\frac{1+𝑔}{1+𝑟})^𝑛)
    $$
    

## Perpetuities

- A perpetuity is an annuity with an infinite life; it promises to pay the same amount at the end of every year forever
    - Perhaps the simplest modern example of a perpetuity is preferred equity issued by corporations. Preferred shares promise investors a constant annual (or quarterly) dividend payment forever
- The present value is then given by the following sum which discounts all the infinite cash flows over the years simplifies to a simple expression:
    
    $$
    PV = CF \times \sum _{t-1} ^{\infty} (\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}) = \frac{CF}{r}
    $$
    
- Just as you have deferred annuities and annuities due you can also have deferred perpetuities and perpetuities due

### Constant Growth Perpetuities

- A perpetuity where the regular cash flows are expected to grow at a constant rate g per period after the first cash flow ($CF_1$):
    
    $$
    PV_0 = \frac{CF_1}{r-g}
    $$
    

# Topic 3: Debt

## **Amortising loans**

- Amortising Loans means creating a plan of payments to payback the lumpsum for a loan
- By doing this we can answer questions like:
    - What is the regular monthly payment required?
    - How much will I still owe at different points of the loan’s life?
    - What impact will a change in interest rates have on my regular payment? What if I keep the payment and vary the loan term?
    - What is the total amount of interest I can expect to pay over the life of the loan?
- The formula we use is the ordinary annuity formulas as the payments function like an ordinary annuity
- To find the regular monthly payments we solve for CF in the PV formula for an ordinary annuity
    - But note that the interest rate will be given as p.a. and the loan will be compounding monthly so we divide by 12 to get a effective monthly rate
    - And the n must be expressed as the months in the loan period
- To find how much is still owed at different points of a loan’s life you find the present value of all future payments
- To calculate the interest payments/principle payments over a period of time you do the following:
    1. Find the total amount already paid 
        1. $Amount \space paid  \space to \space date = monthly \space payment \times number \space of \space payment$
    2. Find the principle already repaid 
        1. $Total \space principle \space repaid = total \space principle - how  \space much \space is \space still \space owed$
    3. Then find the interest paid:
        1. $Total \space interest \space paid = Amount \space paid  \space to \space date - total \space principle \space repaid$
- To calculate new monthly payments if interest rates change you solve for the CF in the PV formula for an ordinary annuity where:
    - PV is the total amount still owing
    - r is the new interest rate divided by 12
- To calculate the new time left if interest rates change and you keep the payments the same you solve for the in the PV formula for an ordinary annuity where:
    - PV is the total amount still owing
    - r is the new interest rate divided by 12
    - CF is the monthly payments
    - NOTE: This will only be able to happen you original payment at least matches the interest that needs to be paid on the principle on the new interest rate, if interest rates increase very dramatically such that you can’t even pay off the interest required each month you will never be able to pay off the loan
- Ex: You borrow $600,000 for your first apartment. The term of the loan is 20 years and the interest rate quoted by your bank is 4.8% p.a. compounding monthly with monthly payments required
    - What is the regular monthly payment required?
        
        ![Untitled](Untitled%203.png)
        
    - How much do you still owe after 5 years?
        - After 5 years there are still 15 years worth of payments left
        
        ![Untitled](Untitled%204.png)
        
    - How much interest have you paid in that five years?
        - All of your payments go either towards principal repayment or interest payment
            
            ![Untitled](Untitled%205.png)
            
    - If, after 5 years, interest rates increase to 6% p.a. compounding monthly, what will be your new monthly payment required?
        
        ![Untitled](Untitled%206.png)
        
    - Interest rates have increased (to 6% p.a. compounding monthly), what if you keep your loan payment constant but increase the term?

## Debt Securities:

- A “debt security” is a loan that can be traded in the (secondary) market.
    - Examples include bonds, debentures, notes and bills of exchange
- Distinguishing features:
    - Short-term vs long-term;
    - One vs multiple future cash flows;
    - Quoted and traded using simple interest vs compound interest;
    - Secured vs unsecured.
- Types of debt securities:
    - Short term debt securities
        - Term less than 1 year (usually, less than 6 months)
        - Only one future cash flow
        - Quoted and traded using simple interest
    - Long-term debt securities
        - Term more than 1 year
        - More than one future cash flow
        - Quoted and traded using compound interest

## Short-Term Debt Securities

- In Australia, short-term debt securities include:
    - Treasury notes (government debt)
    - Bills of exchange (private debt; usually guaranteed by a bank)
    - Promissory notes (private debt; not guaranteed by a bank)
- In nearly all cases:
    - The term is 6 months or less.
    - There is a single payment (the “face value”) on the maturity date.
    - Typically, the face value is a round number like $500,000.
- In the secondary market, the securities are traded using simple interest on a “yield” basis.

### Treasury Notes

- Debts that are issued by the government
- The present value of a treasury note is found by:
    
    $$
    P_0 = \frac{FV}{(1+r+(\frac{d}{365})}
    $$
    
    - Clearly P and r are inversely related
        - If the required yield (r) increases, then the price (P) decreases
        - If the required yield (r) decreases, then the price (P) increases
- Ex: The government (through the Reserve Bank) issues a 13-week Treasury note. It is bought by Unisuper, a superannuation fund. The note has a face value of $10,000,000 and is issued at a yield of 7.650% pa. 
**a)** What is the price? (That is, how much has the government borrowed?) 
After holding the note for 3 weeks (21 days), Unisuper decided to sell the note in the secondary market to the Commonwealth Bank. Unisuper and the bank agreed that the note should be sold at a yield of 7.550% pa. This rate was determined by market conditions at the time.
**b)** How much will the Commonwealth Bank pay Unisuper?
    1. What is the price?
        - The term of the note is measured precisely as the fraction of a year. 13 weeks is 91 days, so the term of the note in years is 91/365.
        - The holder of the note (the lender) will be paid $10,000,000 on the maturity date.
        - The price of the note is its present value, calculated using a simple interest rate of 7.650% p.a:

### Promissory notes and Bills of exchange

- Promissory notes (also known as one-name paper) are traded and priced in the same way as Treasury notes.
    - Of course, the yields are higher because there is some risk of default.
- Bills of exchange are also traded and priced using the same principles.
    - But the institutional details of a bill are more complex.
    - Bills of exchange are issued (“drawn”) by borrowers who need or want a bank guarantee that they will repay.
    - Also known as “Bank Bills”
- As with Treasury notes, there is an active secondary market in bank bills.
    - A bill may be traded many times during its life.
    - When a bill is sold in the secondary market, the seller usually “endorses” the bill.
    - This means that in the (extremely unlikely) event that both the borrower and the accepting bank do not pay as promised, any endorser may be required to pay

## Long-Term Debt Securities

- In Australia, long-term debt securities include:
    - Commonwealth Government securities (“bonds”)
    - Semi-government bonds
    - Debentures (private sector)
        - In Australia, secured
    - Corporate bonds (private sector)
        - In Australia, usually not secured
- These bonds almost always pay a fixed interest rate as well as promising the repayment of face value
    - These bonds are known as coupon-paying bonds
- These coupon-paying bonds typically pay coupons annually or semi-annually (twice a year)
- To find the value of the bond during it’s life we use the following:
    
    $$
    PV = \frac{C}{r}(1 - \frac{1}{(1+r)^n})+\frac {FV_n}{(1+r)^n}
    $$
    
    - $FV$ = Face Value (or Par Value) of bond
    - $C$ = Coupon payment = $c × FV$
    - $n$ = Number of coupon payments over the life of the bond
    - $r$ = Current required return from the bond = “yield to maturity” = required return = interest rate
- What determines the coupon rate when the bond is issued?
    - When the bond is first issued – the coupon rate c is set equal to the current required rate of return from the bond (yield to maturity) r so that the company is able to raise the FV (face value) of the bond (i.e. PV = FV)
    - But this coupon rate doesn’t change
- After exactly a year, assuming the first coupon has just been paid what will be the value of the bond assuming interest rates haven’t changed?
    - The value of the bond will still be the same, as even though you gave up 1 coupon you waited 1 less period
- Let’s assume that the initial purchaser of the bond holds the bond for one and a half years and then sells it. Assuming that bond yields have not changed (i.e. ytm = 8.5% p.a.) what is the value of the bond?
    - Unlike the previous example, the value of the bond is greater than the face value, this is because 6 months ago there was 1 year left until the first payment, but as we wait 6 months less than before the price of the bond will increase, of alternatively you bring the face value at 6 months ago, 6 months into the future by compounding
- Bond Yields:
    - “Yield to maturity”.
    - It is the rate of return required by the investor (the bond buyer).
    - Why would an investor require a return of 8.5% pa on a 5-year bond?
        - Because that is the yield obtainable from other similar bonds
        - Similar in terms of risk and term to maturity
    - It is the discount rate that equates the price of a bond to its present value.
    - It is constantly changing
    - The YTM represents an equivalent return of the same bond if issued right now, and can be compared with the coupon rate to see the difference in cash flows
    - The YTM and the price of a bond is inversely related as if the YTM increases, the bond promises a lower return than the required rate in the market and thus investors will pay less for it thus decreasing it’s price
        - This is assuming that the payment of the coupon is one period away
        - If the payment of the coupon is less than 1 period away, you would have accrued interest/ would wait less time for the coupon to be paid thus less discounting so the price would increase as the time gets closer to the coupon payment date, then immediately after the coupon payment the price will drop back to below the face value
            - This cycle will continue until the maturity date, but the whole cycle will trend upwards with the lowest amount converging to the face value+last coupon, this is because you will be receiving less of the lower coupon payments until the maturity date in which you receive the coupon payment and the face value
    - During its life, if a bond’s coupon rate is less than the yield to maturity (i.e. c < r), then immediately after a coupon payment, it will trade at a discount (P < FV).
        - It’s known as a discount bond
        - As you are receiving less than you require so you pay less
    - During its life, if a bond’s coupon rate is greater than the yield to maturity (i.e. c > r), then it will always trade at a premium to face value (P > FV).
        - It’s known as a premium bond
        - As you are receiving more than you require so you pay more
    - Semi-annual coupons
        - Often bonds will pay coupons twice-yearly (semi-
        annually)
        - These bonds are priced in exactly the same way as annual coupon bonds – we just need to use an effective half-yearly yield to discount the half-yearly cash flows

## Yields

- A key driver of a bond’s yield is the risk associated with the promised cash flows
- Ratings agencies assess this risk and allocate the bond a rating
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%2013.png)
    
- The greater the perceived risk of a bond the higher the yield relative to other less risky bonds
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%2014.png)
    
- Yields can change because a rating can change BUT ultimately yields just reflect the impact of demand and supply on bond prices
- One of the drivers of yields is the risk-free rate of return (Gov’t bond rate). When we look at yield spreads we’re deducting the impact of changes in the risk-free rate

## Green Bonds

- Green bonds share many features with non-green bonds
    - Tend to be fixed rate
    - Long-term
    - Promise of coupon payments plus the repayment of the face value at maturity
- They differ from ordinary bonds in terms of the use of the funds raised

# Topic 4: Equity

## Equity - Features and Characteristics

- “equity” means an ownership claim on a company
    - Equity holder is a part-owner of the company
- Two main types of equity:
    - Ordinary (common stock)
    - Preferred (preferred shares)
- Equity or stock normally refers to ordinary shares
- Shareholders are not promised a specific rate of return compared to debt which includes a fixed promise
    - They have a residual claim to a return on capitals
        - Dividends are paid out of earning
    - They also residual claim to a return of capitals
        - Shareholders stand last in line to receive money, after debt holders, creditors, employees

### P/E Ratio

- Price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is a financial ratio commonly used to measure the relative
valuations of listed firms
    - It is literally how much the market values each $ of earnings
    - Found by:
        
        $$
        𝑃𝐸 \space 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 = \frac{𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 \space 𝑝𝑒𝑟 \space 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒}{𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 \space 𝑝𝑒𝑟 \space 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒} \\ = \frac{𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡 \space 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛}{𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙\space 𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠}
        $$
        

## Equity – pricing using the Dividend Growth Model

- Holders of ordinary shares have three main right:
    - Right to dividends that are declared
    - To sell their shares
    - To vote for members of the board of directors
- Shares have value:
    - Dividends are worth something (cash)
    - The right to sell is worth something (realising gains)
    - The right to vote isn’t worth that much
- As only cash can be spent right now and as dividends are cash flows, we value a firm by reference to the cash flows it produces for its owners
- The basic valuation model used is:
    
    $$
    P_0 =\frac{D_1}{(1+k_e)^1} + \frac{D_2}{(1+k_e)^2}+\frac{D_3}{(1+k_e)^3}+keeps \space going + \frac{D_n}{(1+k_e)^n}
    $$
    
    - $D_n$ is the expected dividend at time n;
    - $k_e$  is the cost of equity capital and represents the risk-adjusted discount rate used to discount the cash flows of the firm
        - The greater the risk of the firm, the higher the discount rate used
        - It is also called the required rate of return, opportunity cost of capital, etc.
- From this basic model we can make assumptions to value different companies depending on their scenario:
1. Dividends constant and forever
    - As cash flows are permanent and forever we are dealing with a perpetuity
    - But note that the dividend $D_0$ must have been just paid as it is a perpetuity due
    - So:
        
        $$
        Price_0 = \frac{D_0}{k_e}
        $$
        
2. Dividends grow at a constant rate forever
    - As cash flows are growing but forever we are dealing with a growing perpetuity
    - But note that as it is a growing perpetuity due, dividend $D_0$ must have been just paid
    - So assuming growing at a constant rate of growth, g, per period:
        
        $$
        price_0= \frac{D_0(1+g)}{k_e-g} = \frac{D_1}{k_e-g}
        $$
        
        - Price is valued at the start of the year in which $D_0$ has just been paid
        - Important caveat – $g$ must be less than $k_e$
- There are 3 ways to generate a return:
    - Selling at higher price than buying price - capital gain
    - Cash flow from dividends
    - Tax credits
        - Franking credits
- When you buy and sell a stock your realised rate of return is
    
    $$
    r = dividend \space yield + capital \space gain (loss)
    $$
    
    - This will match $k_e$ due to the dividend growth model as the model not only accounts for the value derived from receiving dividends but also from the appreciation of the stock price—i.e., capital gains
- One shortcoming of the dividend growth model is its sensitivity to inputs, so if you slightly change one of the inputs the overall result will be drastically different
- You can also make extensions to the basic model:
    - As you can Build in short-term dividend patterns that differ to long-term patterns
        - For example, consider a fast-growing company in which an analyst may forecast that the dividend growth rate will be high in the next few years, then settle down to a long-term sustainable rate
- Examples:
    - Warner Bats Ltd has just paid an annual dividend of 68 cents per share. Its dividend is expected to grow at 3.5% pa. The required rate of return on the shares is 12.5% pa. Estimate the share price
        
        $$
        price_0= \frac{D_0(1+g)}{k_e-g} = \frac{\$0.68(1.035)}{0.125 − 0.035} = \frac{\$0.7038}{0.09} = \$7.82
        $$
        
    - The current dividend (D0) is 50 cents per share.
    The forecast annual growth rates are 6% in Year 1, 4.5% in Year 2 and 3% p.a. thereafter.
    The required rate of return ($k_e$) is 14% pa.
    Calculate the share price
        
        ![image.png](image.png)
        
        ![image.png](image%201.png)
        
        - Note that the constant dividend is only discounted by 2 years, this is due to the dividend model valuing the share a year before the first dividend payment

## **Earnings, dividends and prices**

- A firm has essentially two choices about what to do with its earnings:
    - Pay it out as dividends
    - Retain earnings to reinvest for growth
- If we define the dividend payout ratio (proportion of earnings distributed) as $\alpha$
    - The ratio of money the firm retained is $1-\alpha$
- So the next dividend payment $D_1 = \alpha \times E_1$
    - Where $E_1$ is the next period’s expected earnings
- If we apply this to the dividend growth model we get:
    
    $$
    P_0 = \frac {\alpha \times E_1}{k_e-g}
    $$
    
    - If $E_1$ is the firm’s total earnings then $P_0$  is the firm’s market capitalisation as $\alpha \times E_1$ gives the total dividend payment given by the whole company
    - If $E_1$  is the firm’s EPS (Earnings per share) then $P_0$  is the share price
- If a firm’s earnings and dividends are forecast not to grow (g = 0), then it must pays out all its earnings as dividends (α = 1) as it has not extra cash to expand and grow, then:
    
    $$
    P_0 = \frac {E_1}{k_e}
    $$
    
- So the difference between the value of the company with growth opportunities and the value of the company without growth opportunities gives us an estimate of the **P**resent **V**alue of **G**rowth **O**pportunities (PVGO):
    
    $$
    PVGO = \frac {\alpha \times E_1}{k_e-g} - \frac {E_1}{k_e}
    $$
    
- Examples:
    - ABC Ltd earnings per share at the end of the next year is expected to be $0.527.
    Its dividend payout ratio is expected to be 53.7%.
    Assume that these earnings per share are expected to grow at 8% p.a. and the required return on ABC’s shares is 12% p.a.
    Estimate the firm’s current price, its P/E ratio (using expected earnings) and the (present) value that can be attached to its future growth opportunities
        1. The firm’s current price of a share
            
            ![image.png](image%202.png)
            
        2. P/E ratio
            
            $$
            PE \space 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 = \frac{𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 \space 𝑝𝑒𝑟 \space 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒}{𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 \space 𝑝𝑒𝑟 \space 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒} = \frac{\$7.08}{0.527} = 13.4
            $$
            
        3. Present value that can be attached to its future growth opportunities (PVGO)
            
            ![image.png](image%203.png)
            
- As we have defined PE ratio as $\frac{𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 \space 𝑝𝑒𝑟 \space 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒}{𝐸𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 \space 𝑝𝑒𝑟 \space 𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒} = \frac{P}{E}$ we can say:
    
    $$
    Current \space P/E \space ratio = \frac{P_0}{E_0} 
    \\ 
    Expected \space P/E \space ratio = \frac{P_0}{E_1}
    $$
    
- Now we can use the previous formula to find an alternate formula for P/E ratio:
    
    $$
    P/E \space ratio = \frac{P_0}{E_1} = \frac {\alpha}{k_e-g}
    $$
    
- Example:
    - ANZ currently has a P/E ratio of 11 while Commonwealth Bank has a P/E ratio of 18
    Is the following statement true or false:
    This implies that ANZ bank is a *cheaper buy* than CBA and we should necessarily prefer it as an investment over CBA
        - For a given level of earnings, and keeping all else constant, the market will pay higher prices for a share when:
            - α is higher (payout is higher)
            - $k_e$  is lower (risk is lower)
            - $g$ is higher (growth is higher)
        - But this is not the case as everything else won’t always be constant
            - Like when $\alpha$ is higher, $g$ normally decreases as the firm has less cash to invest and grow
        - So while ANZ may be lower compared to CommBank, the difference could vary due to wide range of reasons including α, risk and growth expectations
        - Thus we can’t assume that ANZ is a cheaper buy than CBA by only looking at it’s P/E ratio

## Preference equity – characteristics and pricing

- They are a class of hybrid securities:
    - They display characteristics of both debt and equity
- Traditionally they offer:
    - A fixed dividend rate (like interest on debt)
    - An infinite life (like equity)
- Comparing the features of a traditional preference share to equity and debt:
    
    ![image.png](image%204.png)
    
- Pricing preference shares are easy as the preference share promises to pay an infinite stream of a fixed amount each year, so it is a perpetuity:
    
    $$
    P_0 = \frac{D}{k_p}
    $$
    
    - $D$ is the fixed dividend per period
    - $k_p$  is the required return on preference capital
        - Note that we expect $k_e > k_p > k_d$ (opportunity cost of debt)
            - As $k_d$ is a discount rate that includes no risk due to it being the government interest rate
            - While $k_p$ is similar to $k_d$ with a bit of additional risk due to defaulting risk of the firm
- Example:
    - An irredeemable preference share has a face value of $10 and a fixed dividend rate of 8% pa.
    The required rate of return is 12.5% pa.
    What is the price?
        
        ![image.png](image%205.png)
        

## Prices, information and market efficiency

- A market is informationally efficient if prices quickly and unbiasedly reflect all available, relevant information
    - Referred to as the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH)
- Foundation of EMH:
    - A large number of profit-maximizing participants who analyze and value securities independently of each other
    - New information comes to the market in a random manner and the timing of news announcements is independent of each other
    - Market participants adjust their estimates of security prices rapidly to reflect their interpretation of the new information received
        - Does not mean that market participants correctly adjust prices
        - Some market participants may over-adjust and others may under-adjust, but overall the price adjustments will be unbiased
- Implications of EMH:
    - Securities are priced appropriately for their market risk
    - Security prices react quickly to any new information and reach a new equilibrium before investors can exploit that information for abnormal profit/return
        - This does not imply that individual investors can never make abnormal profits or returns
        - It means you shouldn’t **expect** to make abnormal profit/return
    - Market efficiency implies that abnormal profits/returns cannot be made consistently and after taking into account all costs associated with gathering and analyzing information
    - Stock-tipping – in an informationally efficient market we don’t expect to earn positive abnormal returns through stock-tipping abilities
- An application of this is that there is strong evidence over the years that active fund managers struggle to outperform a passive benchmark index
- The market efficiency is classified depending on what type of information is incorporated into prices of securities, the different types are:
    - Weak-form – prices incorporate all information contained in the past record of prices
        - Can’t expect abnormal returns by plotting prices
    - Semistrong-form – prices incorporate all publicly available information
        - Can’t expect abnormal returns by trading on public information (e.g. company announcements)
    - Strong-form – prices incorporate all publicly and privately available information
        - Can’t expect abnormal returns from insider trading
- To test market efficiency you have to gather evidence of different strategies that create positive abnormal returns:
    
    $$
    Abnormal \space return = Actual \space Return - Expected \space Return 
    $$
    
- So for any testing of EMH it assumes we have the correct model of expected return. That is we’re simultaneously testing the correctness of the expected return model.
    - This is known as the joint test problem, as we have no way of knowing if the expected return is correct

# Topic 5: Portfolio Theory and Asset Pricing I

## Realised returns and long-run variability

### **Realised returns and averages**

- At the end of any period the observed/realised return of a security/portfolio is given by the cash flow from the current period plus the capital gain/loss from that period:
    - For equity: $dividend \space yield + capital \space gain(loss)$
    - For bonds: $coupond \space yield + capital \space gain(loss)$
- Using this value we can calculate two types of average return which measure different things:
    - **Arithmetic average** - the average return earned from a single one- period investment over a specific time horizon
        - This basically represents if you were to invest in that investment for only one period what would be you expected return
        - It is given by the following:
            
            $$
            \bar R = \frac{R_1+R_2+...+R_T}{T}
            $$
            
    - **Geometric average** - the average return earned per period from an investment over an investor’s entire time horizon
        - This basically represents the average rate of return per-period that occurred over the life of the investment to give us the final value of the investment
        - It also accounts for the compounding rate of return
        - It is given by the following:
            
            $$
            \bar R_g =((1+R_1)(1+R_2)(1+R_3)...(1+R_T))^{\frac{1}{T}}-1
            $$
            
- As these averages gives us different meanings the arithmetic average return can give misleading results when attempting to link starting prices with ending prices
- For example:
    - You invest $10000 in a security which gives you $15000 at the end of year 1, and $7500 at the end of year two:
        
        ![image.png](image%206.png)
        
        - The following give different return figures
            
            ![image.png](image%207.png)
            
        - In this example, the arithmetic average return is:
            
            ![image.png](image%208.png)
            
        - And the geometric return is:
            
            ![image.png](image%209.png)
            
        - Also note that changing the geometric return to an effective rate over the life of the investment gives the total return
            
            ![image.png](image%2010.png)
            
    - For the following investments compare the arithmetic and geometric average rates of returns. What is the general relationship between these averages?
        
        ![image.png](image%2011.png)
        
        ![image.png](image%2012.png)
        
- The difference between the arithmetic and geometric average change as volatility changes
    - These differences decline as the volatility (or variability) of returns decline
    - These differences increase as the volatility (or variability) of returns increase

### **Realised returns and risk**

- The observed (or realised) risk of a security (or portfolio) is measured by the variability in its realised returns around the (arithmetic) average return
    - The risk is basically how much the realised return moves around the arithmetic average return
    - Note that it is based on historical data
    - The variance of R or the realised variance:
        
        $$
        Var(R) = \frac{1}{T-1}\sum_t^T(R_t-\bar R)^2
        $$
        
    - The realised standard deviation:
        
        $$
        Var(R) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T-1}\sum_t^T(R_t-\bar R)^2}
        $$
        
- When we are calculating the value of r over many years in the past, the effect of inflation becomes more pronounced
- Up until now all the values of R we have calculated have been nominal values (not including the impact of inflation) but we can convert this to the real rate of return (the actual increase in purchasing power) by using the Fisher Effect Formula:
    
    $$
    (1+r)=(1+r_r)(1+i)
    $$
    
    - Where:
    - $r$ is the nominal rate of return per annum
    - $r_r$ is the real rate of return (the actual increase in purchasing power!) per annum
    - $i$ is the expected inflation rate per annum

## Probabilities, risk and return measures

- Now instead of looking at historical data we can look at the future and predict what will happen
- To do this assume investors can predict certain possible outcomes ($C_1,C_2,... C_n$) and associate probabilities to these outcomes ($p_1,p_2,...,p_n$) of which may occur in the future
- And for each state we can convert cash flows into rates of return using the initial investment C:
    
    ![image.png](image%2013.png)
    
    - Where: $p_1+p_2 +p_3 +...+p_n = 1$
- From this the expected return considering all outcomes is the expected outcome measured as the weighted average of the individual outcomes:
    
    $$
    
    𝐸(𝑟) = 𝑝_1𝑅_1 + 𝑝_2𝑅_2 + 𝑝_3𝑅_3 + ⋯ + 𝑝_𝑛𝑅_𝑛
    $$
    
- The variance and standard deviation of returns are measures of dispersion around the expected return:
    
    $$
    𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑟) = 𝜎^2 = 𝑝_1(𝑅_1 −𝐸(𝑟))^2 + 𝑝_2(𝑅_2 − 𝐸( 𝑟))^ 2+... +𝑝_𝑛(𝑅_𝑛 − 𝐸( 𝑟))^2
    
    \\𝑆𝐷(𝑟) = \sqrt{𝜎^2} = 𝜎
    $$
    
- Example:
    
    ![image.png](image%2014.png)
    
    - The current price of Stock X is $10 and market analysts forecast that the following three states could occur one year from now. What is the expected return and standard deviation of return for this investment?
        
        ![image.png](image%2015.png)
        
- In the above scenario we looked at a finite number of outcomes, a more general interpretation requires assuming returns are continuously and normally distributed
    - But it can cause problems as it implies an unlimited downside loss potential which is not possible
- The use of normal distributions allows for use of the confidence intervals like:
    - In the previous example for stock X, 𝐸 𝑟 = 7% and 𝜎 = 11.9%
    - Assume you purchased 100 shares of X, investing $1,000
    - The expected value of your investment next period is:
        - $\$1,000(1 + 𝐸(𝑟)) = \$1,000(1.07) = \$1,070$
    - So using the normal distribution there is approximately a 95% probability that the realized return will lie in the range of:
        - $[𝐸(𝑟) – 2𝜎, 𝐸(𝑟) + 2𝜎] \space or \space (–16.8\%,30.8\%)$
    - So, there is ≈ 95% probability that a $1,000 investment in this security will be worth between:
        - $1000(1 – 0.168) = \$832$ and $1000(1 + 0.308) = \$1,308$ next period

## Diversification of risk

### Investor preferences and measuring portfolio risk and return

- When we hold everything else constant, all investors prefer investments with a higher expected return
- There are different types of investors:
    - Risk-averse investor which requires compensation for bearing risk
    - Risk Neutral: Investors that don’t take into account risk when deciding what asset to invest in
    - Risk Seeking: Investors that gain utility from risk, they will be willing to give up some $E(r)$ in order to take on more risk
- The dominant assumption in finance is that investors are risk-averse
- Example:
    - You’re given the following information relating to the only 4 risky securities available for investment. Which security would a risk-averse investor prefer and why?
    a) Security A
    b) Security B
    c) Security C
    d) Security D
    e) Need more information
        
        ![image.png](image%2016.png)
        
        - The answer to this question is E. Need more information
        - As being a risk-averse investor doesn’t mean you won’t take on risks, it just how much extra return you demand on each additional unit of risk, and because we aren’t given this we cannot choose between C and D
- A risk averse investor’s objective is to:
    - Minimize the risk of portfolio of investments, given a desired level of expected return
        
        or
        
    - Maximize the expected return of portfolio of investments, given a desired level of risk
- The simplest (and naïve) way to minimize risk is to diversify across different securities by forming a portfolio of securities
    - Portfolio risk falls as the number of securities in the portfolio increases, but
    - Portfolio risk cannot be entirely eliminated using this method
    - The risk that cannot be eliminated is called systematic risk

### Portfolio Risk and Return: 2 Assets:

- In a portfolio of 2 assets portfolio’s expected return is the weighted average of the
expected returns of its component securities
    - Note that the weights are percentages of the investor’s original wealth invested in each security
    - It is assumed that all the available funds are invested in the two securities
    - So:
        
        $$
        𝐸(𝑟_𝑝) = 𝑤_1𝐸(𝑟_1) + 𝑤_2𝐸(𝑟_2)\\
        w_j = \frac{𝐴𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 \space 𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑑 \space 𝑖𝑛 \space 𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 \space 𝑗}{𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 \space 𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 \space 𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑑} \\
        w_1+w_2=1
        $$
        
- This portfolio’s variance is the weighted average of the variance of its component securities and the covariance between the securities’ returns:
    
    $$
    Var(r_p)= \sigma^2_p = 𝑤_1^2𝜎_1^2 + 𝑤_2^2𝜎_2^2 + 2𝑤_1𝑤_2𝜎_{1,2}
    $$
    
    - Note that $\sigma_{1,2}$  or $Cov(r_1,r_2)$ is the covariance between the returns of assets 1 and 2
        - This is the way in which the two assets co-vary with each other
    - Note that the third term can be negative
- And thus the standard deviation of the portfolio returns is:
    
    $$
    SD(r_P) = \sigma_r = \sqrt{𝑤_1^2𝜎_1^2 + 𝑤_2^2𝜎_2^2 + 2𝑤_1𝑤_2𝜎_{1,2}}
    $$
    
- The covariance of returns ( $\sigma_{1,2}$  or $Cov(r_1,r_2)$) measures the level of co-movement between security returns
    - If we define $𝑟_{𝑗𝑘}$ = Return on security $j = 1,2$ in state $k = 1, 2, ...n$
        
        $$
        𝜎_{1,2} = 𝑝_1(𝑟_{11} −𝐸(𝑟_1))(𝑟_{21} − 𝐸(𝑟_2)) + ⋯ + 𝑝_𝑛 (𝑟_{1𝑛} − 𝐸(𝑟_1))(𝑟_{2𝑛} − 𝐸(𝑟_2))
        $$
        
- Different values of $\sigma_{1,2}$ indicate different things:
    - $𝜎_{1,2} > 0$: Above (below) average returns on security 1 tend to coincide with above (below) average returns on security 2
    - $𝜎_{1,2} < 0$: Above (below) average returns on security 1 tend to coincide with below (above) average returns on security 2
    - $𝜎_{1,2 }= 0$: Security 1’s return tends to move independently of security 2’s return
- The correlation of returns, $\rho_{1,2} \space  or \space Corr(r_1, r_2)$, is a “standardized” measure of co-movement between two securities
    
    $$
    \rho_{1,2} = \frac{𝜎_{1,2}}{𝜎_1𝜎_2}
    $$
    
    - Note 1: The sign of the return correlation is the same as the sign of the
    return covariance
    - Note 2: $–1 ≤ ρ_{1,2} ≤ +1$
    
    ![image.png](image%2017.png)
    
- Thus instead of covariance we can use correlation coefficient to represent portfolio’s risk:
    
    $$
    Var(r_p)= \sigma^2_p = 𝑤_1^2𝜎_1^2 + 𝑤_2^2𝜎_2^2 + 2𝑤_1𝑤_2𝜎_{1}\sigma_2\rho_{1,2}
    $$
    
    $$
    SD(r_P) = \sigma_r = \sqrt{𝑤_1^2𝜎_1^2 + 𝑤_2^2𝜎_2^2 + 2𝑤_1𝑤_2𝜎_{1}\sigma_2\rho_{1,2}}
    $$
    

## Risk and return tradeoff

- Consider the second expression for a portfolio’s variance (and standard deviation) of returns again
    
    $$
    Var(r_p)= \sigma^2_p = 𝑤_1^2𝜎_1^2 + 𝑤_2^2𝜎_2^2 + 2𝑤_1𝑤_2𝜎_{1}\sigma_2\rho_{1,2}
    $$
    
- As the risk return tradeoff in a two security portfolio depends on the level of co-movement (or correlation) between their returns
- We can separate it into 3 cases:
    - Scenario 1: Return correlation ($ρ$) of +1 (perfect positive correlation)
        - As there are no gains from diversification as the portfolio’s risk (standard deviation) is simply the weighted average of the standard deviations of the two securities
            
            $$
            Var(r_p)= \sigma^2_p = (𝑤_1𝜎_1 + 𝑤_2𝜎_2)^2
            $$
            
            $$
            SD(r_P) = \sigma_r = 𝑤_1𝜎_1 + 𝑤_2𝜎_2
            $$
            
    - Scenario 2: Return correlation ($ρ$) of –1 (perfect negative correlation)
        - There will be maximum gains from diversification in this case
        - It is always possible to construct a zero risk portfolio in this case – need to just adjust the weights accordingly
            
            $$
            Var(r_p)= \sigma^2_p = (𝑤_1𝜎_1 - 𝑤_2𝜎_2)^2
            $$
            
            $$
            SD(r_P) = \sigma_r = \sqrt{(𝑤_1𝜎_1 - 𝑤_2𝜎_2)^2}
            $$
            
        - We can create a risk-free portfolio by letting $σ_p = 0$ and solve for $w_1$ and $w_2$ using the above equation and how the weighting must be 1
    - Scenario 3: Return correlation between ($ρ$) +1 and –1 (general case)
        - Some diversification benefits always exist (relative to weighted average risk of assets)
        - How small or large the diversification benefits are depends on the correlation of returns
        - Lower the correlation; the higher the diversification benefits
            
            $$
            Var(r_p)= \sigma^2_p = 𝑤_1^2𝜎_1^2 + 𝑤_2^2𝜎_2^2 + 2𝑤_1𝑤_2𝜎_{1}\sigma_2\rho_{1,2}
            $$
            
            $$
            SD(r_P) = \sigma_r = \sqrt{𝑤_1^2𝜎_1^2 + 𝑤_2^2𝜎_2^2 + 2𝑤_1𝑤_2𝜎_{1}\sigma_2\rho_{1,2}}
            $$
            
    - Scenario 4: No correlation ($\rho =0$
        - As there is no correlation there still is diversification benefit, up to a certain point
        
        $$
        Var(r_p)= \sigma^2_p = 𝑤_1^2𝜎_1^2 + 𝑤_2^2𝜎_2^2
        $$
        
        $$
        SD(r_P) = \sigma_r = \sqrt{𝑤_1^2𝜎_1^2 + 𝑤_2^2𝜎_2^2}
        $$
        
- If we graph the expected return vs standard deviation for different values of $\rho_{1,2}$ we get the following:

# Topic 6: Portfolio Theory and Asset Pricing II

## **Portfolio risk and return: Impact of leverage**

### Borrowing at Risk Free Rate:

- Portfolio leveraging refers to the strategy where an investor borrows funds at the risk-free rate of return and invests all the available funds in a risky security (or portfolio)
- Doing this increases the expected returns, but also increases standard deviation of returns
- The graph below shows the relation between expected returns and the standard deviation of returns for different weighting on each investment:
    
    ![image.png](image%2019.png)
    

### Impact of Short Selling

- Short selling refers to borrowing (typically via a broker) shares, selling them now with a contractual obligation to buy them back later at (an expected) lower price
    - Note that being long a security means you have purchased  it and being short a security means you have sold it
    - Short selling is like risky borrowing to leverage a portfolio
    - This leveraging increases portfolio risk!
- Borrowing and short selling a security A and investing proceeds in security B implies $w_A < 0\%$ and $w_B > 100\%$ such that $w_A + w_B = 1$
- If you borrow at a rate below the rate you expect to gain, you increase expected return
- The graph below shows the relation between expected returns and the standard deviation of returns for different weighting on each investment:
    
    ![image.png](image%2020.png)
    

## Analyze the limitations to the benefits of risk diversification

- Instead of two securities in a portfolio, imagine we keep adding more securities to our portfolio, what will happen to our risk, will it eliminate risk after a certain point?
- Consider this scenario:
    - You have portfolios of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 stocks where you invest 1/N of your wealth in each stock, where each stock has a standard deviation of return of 10%, and where each pair of stocks has a return correlation of 0.6.
    - Calculate the standard deviations for these portfolios.
    - What general relation between portfolio standard deviation and the number of stocks is being illustrated here?
        - With the following assumptions:
            
            $$
            𝑤_𝑗 = \frac{1}{𝑁},\\𝜎_𝑗 = 𝜎_𝑘 = 𝜎 = 10\%, \\ 𝜌_{𝑗,𝑘} = 𝜌 = 0.6 < 1.0 \space 𝑓𝑜𝑟 \space 𝑎𝑙𝑙 \space 𝑗, 𝑘
            $$
            
        - For a 2 asset portfolio:
            
            ![image.png](image%2021.png)
            
        - For a 4 asset portfolio:
            
            ![image.png](image%2022.png)
            
        - This creates this general formula:
            
            $$
            \sigma_P^2 = \frac{1}{N}\sigma^2+(\frac{N-1}{N})\sigma_{j,k}
            $$
            
        - If we take $N \rightarrow \infin$ as we have a portfolio with every stock you can think of:
            - $\frac{1}{N} \rightarrow 0$
            - $\frac{N-1}{N} \rightarrow 1 \Rightarrow (\frac{N-1}{N})\sigma_{j,k} \rightarrow \sigma_{j,k}$
        - So the formula now is:
            
            $$
            \sigma_P^2= \sigma_{j,k}
            $$
            
            - If $N \rightarrow \infin$
- So, In large portfolios, **return covariances determine portfolio risk**
- As a portfolio becomes large in size its total risk (standard deviation) falls, but at a declining rate, this limiting value of risk is what’s called systematic risk, and the one that disappears with diversification is called unsystematic risk:

![image.png](image%2023.png)

## Explain the relation between systematic risk and expected return using the CAPM

### The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

- The CAPM is a theoretical model that can be used to “price” individual securities
    - Pricing” a security here means estimating its required rate of return (using the CAPM) and then obtaining a price estimate based on the security’s future expected cash flows (that is, dividends and future price)
- The CAPM relates a security’s required rate of return to its non-diversifiable or systematic risk
    - The higher the systematic risk the higher the required rate of
    return
- The CAPM has certain assumptions for it to be accurate:
    - Investors are risk averse individuals who maximize the expected utility of their end-of-period wealth
    - Investors make portfolio decisions on the basis only of expected return and the variance (or standard deviation) of returns
    - Investors have homogeneous expectations about the volatilities, correlations and expected returns of securities
    - The returns on these securities are jointly normally distributed
    - Capital markets are perfect as there are no taxes, transactions costs or government interference
    - Unlimited borrowing and lending at the risk-free rate is possible
    - Investors only hold efficient portfolios of securities that are all traded in financial markets

### Risk-return frontiers with many securities

- The **efficient frontier** of portfolios is a plot of all portfolios that give the highest rate of return for a given level of standard deviation
    - In the graph on the right, the line F’F is the efficient frontier line
    - Note that all the portfolios consist of risky assets
- If a risk-averse investor were to pick one of the portfolios on the line, you couldn’t determine which portfolio they would pick as their risk-compensation level would different’
- Now if we introduce a risk-free asset to combine with the efficient frontier line, we can maximise the expected return if the new portfolio consists for the portfolio M on the efficient frontier line and the risk-free line
- This will create a tangent line through point M on F’F
    - This line is called the **Capital Market Line**

![image.png](image%2024.png)

![image.png](image%2025.png)

- In equilibrium, portfolio M consists of all risky securities/asset in existence
    - This is also called the market portfolio M
- While in theory M must have all the securities traded on financial markets, we normally use market indices as a proxy for M
    - Such as the ASX 200 index , S&P 500 index, All Ordinaries index, Dow Jones Index
- Note that the capital market line (CML) can only be used to “price” efficient portfolios (which lie of the line $r_fM$)
    - Here “pricing” a portfolio is used in the context of obtaining the portfolio’s expected return
- As the CML /portfolio M consists of all risky assets its free of diversifiable/unsystematic  risk and only contains systematic risk
- The CML cannot be used to “price” individual securities because these are not efficient and will always have some unsystematic (or diversifiable) risk

### Intuition Behind CAPM

- CAPM makes the assumption that all investors hold efficient portfolios comprising the market portfolio, M and the risk-free security
    - Investors who don’t diversify, gain no increase in expected return as they are bearing this additional (diversifiable) risk that can be reduced.
    - As you gain compensation for bearing risk in the market, you cannot demand extra compensation if you can get rid of certain risk
- So in the CAPM the only risk you can demand compensation for is the systematic risk of a efficient portfolio
- So the CAPM in words:
    - $Expected \space return \space on \space asset \space A \space = \space Riskfree \space return \space + \space Risk \space premium$
        - $The \space risk \space premium = Amount \space of \space risk \times \space Market \space price \space of \space risk$
            - The amount of risk is the scaled covariance of the securities return with the returns on the market portfolio ($\beta)$
            - The market price of risk (market risk premium **MRP**) is the return above the risk-free rate that investors earn for holding the (risky) market portfolio
- So putting it together in a formula:
    
    $$
    𝐸(𝑟_j) = 𝑟_𝑓 + (𝐸(𝑟_𝑀) − 𝑟_𝑓) 𝛽_j
    $$
    
    - This gives us the expected return of asset j is equal to the risk free rate of return + the MRP ( extra return that we can demand from the market for bearing risk → $E(r_M)-r_f$) times by beta (measure of systematic risk)
    - Where:
    - $r_f$  - Risk free rate available in the market
    - $E(r_M)$ - Expected rate of return of the market/market proxy
    - $\beta_j$ - The sensitivity of the asset to the market
- A security’s beta measures how sensitive the return is to movements in the market portfolio/market as a whole
    - A measure of systematic risk
- Beta is given by the scaled covariance of returns for the asset and the market portfolio M:
    
    $$
    \beta _j = \frac{\sigma_{j,m}}{\sigma_m^2}=\frac{\rho_{j,m}\sigma_j\sigma_m}{\sigma_m^2}=\frac{\rho_{j,m}\sigma_j}{\sigma_m}
    $$
    
    - So the beta is the volatility of the asset over the volatility of the market
    - Interpreting $\beta$:
        - $β_j = 1$: Security has the same systematic risk as the market portfolio
        - $β_j = 0$: Security has zero systematic risk
        - $β_j < 1$: Security has lower systematic risk than the market portfolio
        - $β_j > 1$: Security has higher systematic risk than the market portfolio
- Assume that it is equally likely that the market portfolio’s return will increase by 5% and decline by 3%
Consider three types of firms: S, T and I.
Type S firms’ returns move by +6% on average when the economy is strong and by –4% when the economy is weak.
Type T firms’ returns move by +8% on average when the economy is strong and +4% when the economy is weak.
Type I firms’ returns do not move with the market.
What are their betas?
    
    ![image.png](image%2026.png)
    
- So you can find the implied beta by:
    
    $$
    \beta_{implied} = \frac{\triangle R_j}{\triangle R_m}
    $$
    
- A big thing to note is that beta is not the same as the return correlation between a
security (portfolio) and the market portfolio!
    
    ![image.png](image%2027.png)
    
- The diagram of the CAPM is the SML but with beta on the x-axis
    - NOTE: The diagram of SML has expected returns vs. risk as standard deviation, while CAPM has expected returns vs beta
- Examples:
    - Assume that the risk-free rate is 7% and the expected market return is 12%.
    What is the market risk premium?
    Locate the expected returns for securities with the following betas on the SML
    Security A: $β_A$ = 1.5
    Security B: $β_B$ = 0.5
    Security C: $β_C$ = –0.5
    Will an investor ever invest in a security like security C? Explain
        
        ![image.png](image%2028.png)
        
        - As the expected return of security is well below the risk free asset, an investor is very unlikely to invest in this security unless they are short the market
        
        ![image.png](image%2029.png)
        
    - An online broker’s estimate of Computershare’s (ASX: CPU) beta is 0.7. Using a risk-free return of 4% and an expected market risk premium of 7% p.a. what is CPU’s  required rate of return?
        
        ![image.png](image%2030.png)
        
    - What would you expect to happen to the security market line, required returns and security prices if the following events occurred one after the other:
    Event 1: There is an unexpected increase in the market risk premium as a result of skepticism related to the Commonwealth government’s fiscal stimuli
    Event 2: The Reserve Bank lowers the cash rate, a move also not expected by the market
    Event 3: A few months later, as the economy and financial markets recover, the Reserve Bank raises the cash rate by 0.5%, a move widely expected by the market
        
        ![image.png](image%2031.png)
        

## **Estimating expected return using the CAPM**

- An individual asset’s beta can be estimated using the market model regression which is:
    
    $$
    𝑅_{𝑗,𝑡} = 𝛼_𝑗 + 𝛽_𝑗𝑅_{𝑚,𝑡} + 𝑒_{𝑗,𝑡} \space for \space 𝑡 = 1,2, …,T
    $$
    
    - Where:
    - 𝛼𝑗 is the intercept
    - 𝛽𝑗 is the regression’s slope
    - 𝑒𝑗,𝑡 is the error term
- Note that the market model is an empirical model while the CAPM is a theoretical model
- Recall what happens to total risk ($σ_P$ ) when we combine assets into a portfolio
    
    $$
    𝜎_𝑃 < 𝑤_1𝜎_1 + 𝑤_2𝜎_2 \space provided \space 𝜌_{1,2} < +1
    $$
    
    - Reflecting the “diversification benefit”
- But systematic risk – as measured by beta – is undiversifiable risk.
- The beta of a portfolio of assets is simply the weighted average of the betas of the assets in that portfolio
    
    $$
    𝛽_𝑃 = 𝑤_1𝛽_1 + 𝑤_2𝛽_2 + ⋯ + 𝑤_𝑛𝛽_n
    $$
    
- In addition to the beta, the other parameters that need to be estimated are:
    - The risk-free rate, $𝑟_𝑓$
        - Generally estimated as the yield to maturity on long-term government bonds
        - The 10-year bond rate in Australia, 10- or 30-year rates in the US
    - The market risk premium, $𝐸(𝑟_𝑀) − 𝑟_𝑓$
        - Generally estimated as an historical average premium

## **CAPM and security selection**

- Security selection involves identifying securities that are under- or over-valued at present
- In the CAPM’s context, correctly priced securities will lie on the security market line implying that investing in them is a zero NPV decision
- In contrast, under- or over-valued securities will not lie on the security market line implying that investing in them is a non-zero NPV decision
- Example:
    - Around November 2018 Asjeet was considering whether to purchase more shares of Sonic Healthcare (ASX: SHL).
    Sonic is a health care company that offers laboratory medicine/pathology and radiology/diagnostic imaging services to clinicians, hospitals, community health services and their patients. It operates 233 primary care clinics in Australia, the US, Germany, and internationally.
    Asjeet used Sonic’s estimated beta of 0.7, a risk-free rate of 4% and an expected market risk premium of 7% to estimate the required return on its shares.
    At that time, the consensus estimate of Sonic’s dividend next year was $0.85 which was expected to grow at 5.5% p.a. for the foreseeable future

# Topic 7: Capital Budgeting I

## Capital budgeting and Net Present Value (NPV)

- Capital budgeting process involves the following main steps:
    - Generation of investment proposals
    - Evaluation and selection of investment proposals
    - Approval and control of capital expenditures
    - Post-completion audit of investment projects

### Net Present Value (NPV)

- Net present value seeks to identify the net impact in wealth that would occur right now if you were to take upon an investment
- It involves:
    - Calculating the difference between the present value of the net cash flows from an investment and the initial investment outlay
    - Discounting cash flows at the required rate of return which reflects the project’s risk
- The projects cash flows are:
    - Incremental (Affected as a result of out decision undertake the investment)
    - The net cash flow after corporate taxes
- The NPV of a project is calculated as:
    
    $$
    𝑁𝑃𝑉 = 𝐶𝐹_0 + \frac{𝐶𝐹_1}{(1 + 𝑟)^1} + \frac{𝐶𝐹_2}{(1 + 𝑟)^2} + \frac {𝐶𝐹_3}{(1 + 𝑟)^3} + ⋯ + \frac{𝐶𝐹_n}{(1 + 𝑟)^n}
    $$
    
    - where:
    - $CF_0$ = Initial investment (normally negative cash flow)
    - $CF_t$ = Net after-tax cash flow at the end of year t
    - $r$ = Project’s required rate of return (a.k.a. discount rate)
    - $n$ = Economic life of the project
- The decision based on the NPV is dependent an it’s value:
    - Accept a project if $NPV > 0$
    - Reject a project if $NPV < 0$
    - If the $NPV =0$ you break even on undertaking the project, as no value is created, it can be thought of returning the same rate of return as the required rate of return for a similar investment so it doesn’t matter if you undertake the investment or not
- Example:
    - The net after-tax cash flows from a four-year project that costs $1 million are as follows.
    Evaluate the project using the net present value method assuming that the project’s required rate of return is 12% p.a.
    How does your decision change if the initial investment were $1,300,000 and not $1,000,000?
        
        ![image.png](image%2036.png)
        
        ![image.png](image%2037.png)
        
- Note that as you increase the required rate of return (discount rate) you decrease the NPV of an investment as you discount it by a bigger amount
- The NPV also indicates an affect on the firm’s share price:
    - As the NPV also reflects the additional wealth created in the firm’s assets, it increases the overall value of the company as $Value \space of \space company = Equity + debt$ and as assets increase ⇒ equity increases ⇒ value of company increases
    - As value of company increases ⇒ share price increase as the number of outstanding shares would remain constant
    - So:
        - $\triangle firm \space value = NPV$
        - $new \space firm \space value = Total \space firm \space value \space before \space investment + NPV$
- As the market is informationally efficient, if a firm was to take on a new investment, it would be quicky reflected in the share price as it would move immediately to the new equilibrium price
- pros and cons of NPV:
    - The NPV rule focuses on cash flow, not accounting earnings.
    - When properly applied, the NPV method makes appropriate adjustments for the time value of money.
    - The decision rule to invest when NPVs are positive and to refrain from investing when NPVs are negative reflects the company’s need to compete for funds in the marketplace and have its projects outperform projects of similar risk.
    - The NPV approach offers a relatively straightforward way to control for differences in risk among alternative investments. Cash flows on riskier investments should be discounted at higher rates.
    - The NPV method incorporates all the cash flows that a project generates over its life, not just those that occur in the project’s early years.
    - The NPV gives a direct estimate of the change in shareholder wealth resulting from a given investment.

### Mutually exclusive vs. independent investments

- Mutually exclusive projects:  The acceptance of one project precludes the acceptance of
the other(s)
- The decision making rule is always accept the project with the highest positive NPV
- Independent projects: The acceptance of one project has no impact on the acceptance of the other(s)
- The decision making rule is always accept all projects with positive NPV

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

- The internal rate of return (IRR) is the rate of return that is expected to be earned by the project over its economic life
- In other words it is the discount rate that when applied to the project’s expected net cash flows it produces a NPV = 0
- So to find IRR:
    - Set NPV equal to 0 and calculate the internal rate of return (IRR)
    
    $$
    𝑁𝑃𝑉 = 0= 𝐶𝐹_0 + \frac{𝐶𝐹_1}{(1 + 𝑟)^1} + \frac{𝐶𝐹_2}{(1 + 𝑟)^2} + \frac {𝐶𝐹_3}{(1 + 𝑟)^3} + ⋯ + \frac{𝐶𝐹_n}{(1 + 𝑟)^n}
    $$
    
    - Decision: Accept the project if $IRR > r$, reject if $IRR < r$
    - However if it is a delayed investment (initial cash flow is positive and subsequent cash outflows) accept if  $IRR<r$, reject if $IRR>r$
    - Unlike NPV, IRR is not affected by scale, so if cash flows double there is no affect to IRR
- IRR is normally one of the best capital budgeting strategy to use but it includes various problems:
    - **Delayed investments**
        - If instead of an initial cash outflow you have an initial cash inflow and subsequent cash outflows, the IRR doesn’t work as expected
        - Example:
            - Assume you have just retired as the CEO of a successful company. A major publisher has offered you a book deal. The publisher will pay you $1 million upfront if you agree to write a book about your experiences. You estimate that it will take three years to write the book. The time you spend writing will cause you to give up speaking engagements amounting to $500,000 per year. What is the book deal’s internal rate of return? If your required rate of return is 10% p.a. should you accept the book deal? How does your decision change if your required rate of return is 28% p.a.?
                
                ![image.png](image%2038.png)
                
                - The NPV is negative, so you shouldn’t accept the book deal but looking at IRR it shows that you should take the deal
                - This is because you are receiving cash flows before cash outflows so it creates a reverse relationship to the traditional IRR
                - As you increase the discount rate you decrease the present value of the future cash outflows
                    - So IRR in this case should be interpreted as the rate being paid by you rather than being earned
                    - As you want to pay at a rate lower than the required rate of return, so accept when $IRR<r$
    - **No IRR**
        - When finding IRR you are solving a polynomial so that means there may not be any real solutions in some cases where the NPV profile never crosses the x axis
        - So the NPV of the project remains positive or negative no matter what discount rate is applied to the net cash flows
        - In this case you use NPV
    - **Multiple IRR**
        - When finding IRR you are solving a polynomial so that may mean you get multiple values for the NPV up to the degree of its power (number of years in the future the cash flow occurs)
            
            ![image.png](image%2039.png)
            

## Comparing NPV and IRR - Incremental IRR

- When ranking mutually exclusive investments we sometimes get differing results from NPV and IRR:
    
    ![image.png](image%2040.png)
    
    - Looking at the figures you should undertake project Y as even though you need a greater initial investment you generate a greater return nearly double of project X, so while IRR doesn’t account for scale it sometimes is a bad thing as sometimes the scale of the investment generates a bigger return over the rate of return
- When comparing NPV to IRR, NPV is sensitive to the required rate of return so it depends on what you choose as the required rate of return which may affect the NPV value while the IRR is unaffected of your choice of the required rate of return

### Incremental IRR

- For mutually exclusive projects, the IRR and NPV methods can be made consistent by considering the incremental “projects” A – B (or B – A)
- It answers the question of what incremental wealth would be created if you take one project over the other
    - If NPV of $A-B$ is positive you get incremental wealth from investing in project A over and above project B
    - If we wanted to analyse using IRR, we would find the incremental IRR (found from finding IRR of the incremental cash flows) and then compare it to the required rate of return, if it is greater than the required rate of return we prefer the project we used as positive in the incremental cash flow calculations
- The incremental IRR is also the crossover point in which the NPV of one investment starts becoming bigger than the other, so its when the NPV of two investments equal each-other
- When using incremental IRR take note of if the cash flows are in normal terms or in a delayed investment terms
- Problems with incremental IRR:
    - The incremental IRR may not exist
    - Multiple incremental IRRs can exist
    - The fact that the IRR exceeds the required rate of return for both projects does not necessarily imply that either project has a positive NPV
    - The individual projects may have different required rates of return
        - Not clear which required rate of return should be used to compare with the incremental IRR

## Alternative methods to NPV and IRR and empirical evidence

### Payback Period

- A project’s payback period is the time it takes for the initial cash outlay on a project to be recovered from the net (after-tax) cash flows
    - The discounted payback period does the same thing but uses discounted cash flows
- Decision rules:
    - A project is acceptable if its payback period is less than a prespecified maximum payback period
    - For mutually exclusive projects, the project with the shortest payback period is preferred (assuming they all meet the maximum payback period threshold)
- Example:
    
    ![image.png](image%2041.png)
    
    - A firm is considering three mutually exclusive projects that require an initial outlay of $100,000 and that generate the following pattern of cash flows. The firm typically accepts projects with a payback period less than 2 years
        - Note: Payback period for project E = 2+(20/30)=2.67 years
        - In this case you would take project C as it has the least project payback period of 1 year
- The payback period does have some problems as it fails to take account of the cash flows that occur after the payback period cut-off date
    - It is biased against projects that have longer development periods
    - Examples: Mining and exploration projects
- Like if a project had already paid back its initial cost but it had a huge cash inflow/outflow later in its life, it wouldn’t be represented in the payback period

### Accounting rate of return

- A project’s accounting rate of return (ARR) equals the average earnings generated by the project, after deducting depreciation and taxes, expressed as a percentage of the investment outlay:
    
    $$
    ARR = \frac{Average \space Earnings}{Initial \space Investment} \times 100
    $$
    
- Decision rules:
    - A project is acceptable if its ARR exceeds a prespecified minimum rate of return
    - For mutually exclusive projects the project with the highest ARR is preferred (provided it exceeds minimum)
- The accounting rate of return also has problems:
    - Earnings are not net cash flows
        - Earnings numbers are subject to the vagaries of the accounting choices made by managers
    - Time value of money is ignored
        - A dollar of earnings tomorrow is regarded as equivalent to a dollar of earnings today
    - ARR tends to favour projects with shorter lives
        - So if a project has a small number of cashflows even though it received less cash than another project it will be favoured as it contains less cash flows

# Topic 8: Capital Budgeting II

## Issues in Cash Flow Estimation

- When using budgeting techniques we get some issues when estimating cash flows:
    1. Timing of cash flows
        - The exact timing of project cash flows can affect the valuation of a project
        - The simplifying assumption made is that, in the absence of other information, the net cash flows occur at the end of a period
    2. Financing charges
        - Cash flows relating to how the project is to be financed are excluded from the analysis
        - A project’s evaluation should be made independently of how it will be financed
        - Note that the required rate of return (or hurdle rate) used to evaluate the project represents the rate of return required by contributors of capital
        - The finance charges are excluded from the outflows as the interest rate should not affect the investment decision as that should be a financing issue not an investing issue and the financing cost is also reflected in the required rate of return
    3. Incremental cash flows
        - Only cash flows that change if the project is accepted are relevant in evaluating a project
            - Need to be careful with sunk costs and fixed overhead costs
    4. Sunk Costs
        - Costs that may be related to the project but have been incurred in the past
    5. Fixed Overhead Cost
        - Overhead costs are typically allocated by management to firm’s divisions. For example, administrative costs incurred by the head office and allocated to divisions
        - Overhead costs is **not** incremental to the decision to accepting the cost
        - Exception: if the overhead cost change depending on the decision to take on the investment
- Net Working Capital (NWC)
    - $NWC = Current \space Assets \space - \space Current \space Liabilities$
    - $NWC = Cash+Inventory+Account \space Receivables - Account \space Payables$
- The change in NWC is defined as:
    - An increase in net working capital is a cash outflow and is an incremental cost associated with the project (e.g., an increase in inventory or a reduction in accounts payable that are being paid off by the company)
    - A decrease in net working capital is a cash inflow associated with the project (e.g., sale of inventory or a loan from suppliers)
- Generally NWC increases at the start of the project then decreases at the end of the project
- As all cashflows are considered on an after tax basis it need to be included as they have an effect on the net cash flows generated by a project
- Taxes have three main effects on net cash flows:
    - Corporate income taxes
    - Depreciation tax shield
    - Taxes on disposal of assets
- Corporate income taxes
    - Corporate taxes should be included as a cash outflow
    - $After-tax \space  cash \space flow = Before-tax \space cash \space flow × (1–t_c)$
    - $t_c$- The effective corporate tax rate
- Depreciation tax shield:
    - Accounting depreciation involves the allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life
    - Depreciation itself is not an operating expense and is excluded from the net cash flows
    - However, depreciation affects net cash flows as it decreases the taxes payable due to the depreciation tax shield
    - $Depreciation \space tax \space savings (or \space shield) = t_c × Depreciation \space expense$
- Salvage (or scrap) value of assets
    - The salvage (or scrap) value of assets needs to be taken into account after taxes
    - Taxes are payable when an asset is sold for more than its book value
    - There is a tax saving when an asset is sold for less than its book value as the loss can be offset against the firm’s taxable income
        - $Book \space value = Acquisition \space cost – Accumulated \space depreciation$
        - $Gain\space  (or \space loss) = Disposal\space value – Book\space value$
        - $Taxes\space payable\space on\space gain = t_c × Gain\space on\space sale$
        - $Tax\space saving\space on\space loss = t_c × Loss\space on\space sale$
- Now we put it together:
    - The periodic cash flows are the incremental net after- tax cash flows (or free cash flows), defined as... $C_t$:
        
        $$
        C_t = Operating \space revenues\space in\space time t, R_t
        \\ \quad minus \\
        Operating \space cost \space in \space time \space t, OC_t
        \\ \quad minus \\ 
        Taxes\space paid \space in \space time \space t, (R_t – OC_t – D_t)t_c
        $$
        
        - Note that $D_t$ = Depreciation expense in time t
    - The typical non-periodic cash flows are:
        - The initial and future investment outlays, $I_0$  and $I_t$
        - Changes in net working capital, $ΔNWC_0$  and/or $ΔNWC_t$
        - After-tax salvage (or scrap) value, $SV_t$
    - So the net after-tax periodic cash flows from a project are:
        
        $$
        C_t = R_t – OC_t – Taxes_t
        \\ C_t = (R_t – OC_t)(1 – t_c) + t_cD_t
        $$
        
- So over the life of the project:
    
    ![image.png](image%2042.png)
    

### Terminal Values

- Not all projects have a clearly defined end date
- In such cases assume the project hits a steady states and value it as a growing perpetuity
- For example:
    - Assume that Microsoft had projected the following cash flows associated with its LinkedIn acquisition in 2016
        
        ![image.png](image%2043.png)
        
    - Assume also that from end of year 5 onwards Microsoft expected the cash flows to grow at a rate of 2% p.a. forever and that it used a discount rate of 12% to value this acquisition.
    - What was LinkedIn’s estimated value to Microsoft?
        
        ![image.png](image%2044.png)
        

## Inflation and capital budgeting

- It is important to be consistent in the treatment of inflation
    - For nominal cash flows use the nominal discount rate (not accounting for inflation)
    - For real cash flows use the real discount rate (accounting for inflation)
- If you become consistent you will reach the same NPV in each case

## Projects with different lives

- If we are comparing two mutually exclusive projects with different lives, using the regular NPV you don’t account for any additional value created between the end of the shorter project and the longer project
- To tackle this problem we use the constant chain of replacement assumption in which we constantly replicate the projects until we end up with chains of cashflows which end at the same point in time
- We can do this using the LCM of the two project lives by the constant chain of replacement
- or we can use the NPV in perpetuity referred to as $NPV_\infin$ which is found discounting the NPV of the project every time we reinvest in perpetuity leading to the following formula:
    
    $$
    𝑁𝑃𝑉_\infin = 𝑁𝑃𝑉_0(\frac{(1 + 𝑟)^𝑁}{(1 + 𝑟)^𝑁−1})
    $$
    
- or we can use the equivalent annual value method, which takes the NPV and finds the equivalent annual cash flow that if received yield the $NPV_0$
- The link between EAV and $NPV_∞$ is simple
    - If you assume that you are going to receive EAV at the end of each year forever then:
        
        $$
        NPV_\infin = \frac{EAV}{r}
        $$
        
- However there are some problems with the constant chain of replacement technique as it relies on the assumption that it’s reasonable to assume identical replication of projects until cash flow chains are of equal length
- So you should be cautious using the technique when such an assumption is not reasonable:
    - Industries subject to rapid technological change
    - Projects that have been conducted to take advantage of temporary market conditions
- Alternative treatments of the different lives problem would involve somehow forecasting what happens between the end of the project with the shorter life and the end of the project with the longer life

## The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

- The weighted average cost of capital ($WACC \space or \space r_0$) is the benchmark required rate of return (or hurdle rate) used by a firm to evaluate its investment opportunities
    - It is basically the discount rate used to evaluate projects of similar risk to the firm
- WACC takes into account how a firm finances its investments
- The WACC depends on:
    - The market values of the alternative sources of funds
    - The market costs associated with these sources of funds
- To estimate the WACC we need to:
    1. Identify the financing components
    2. Estimate the current market values of the financing components
    3. Estimate the cost of each financing component
    4. Estimate the WACC
- First we value each source of funds to a firm:
    - Debt (bonds):
        - Obtain the number of bonds on issue from the balance sheet and use the market price to get the total market value of bonds
    - Ordinary Shares:
        - Obtain the number of issued shares on issue from the balance sheet and use the market price to get the total market value of ordinary shares
    - Preference Shares:
        - Obtain number of issued shares on issue from the balance sheet and use the market price to get the total market value of preference shares
- Using this we get the before-tax WACC as:
    
    $$
    r_0 = r_d(\frac{D}{V})+r_e(\frac{E}{V})+r_p(\frac{P}{V})
    $$
    
    - Where:
    - 𝑟𝑑 = Cost of debt
    - 𝑟𝐸 = Cost of ordinary equity
    - 𝑟𝑃 = Cost of preference equity
    - $D$ = Market value of debt
    - $E$ = Market value of equity
    - $P$ = Market value of preference equity
    - $V$ = Market value of assets (D + E + P)
- This is mostly useless as it is on a before-tax basis
- Under the “classical” tax system:
    - Interest on debt is tax deductible
    - Dividends have no tax effect for the firm (not deductible)
- So the after-tax WACC is:
    
    $$
    r_0 = r_d(1-t_c)(\frac{D}{V})+r_e(\frac{E}{V})+r_p(\frac{P}{V})
    $$
    
    - Only the debt is considered for tax purposes as the interest paid on debt in tax deductible
    - $t_c$ is the effective corporate tax rate
- There are limitations on the WACC:
    - The WACC cannot be used if
        - The project alters the business risk of the firm
            - By accepting this new project if your mix of debt and equity changes you must change your WACC to be used as a benchmark
        - The project alters the financial risk of the firm by significantly altering the firm’s capital structure
        - The risk of the project is substantially different to the risk of the project

# Topic 9: Capital structure and Payout Policy I

## Introducing financial leverage

- The are two main risks faced by firms are:
    1. **Business (or operational) risk**
        - Risk inherently associated with the assets of the business
        - The variability of future net cash flows attributed to the nature of the firm’s operations
        - It is the risk faced by shareholders if the firm were financed only by equity
    2. Financial Risk
        - Risk from the use of debt as a source of financing a firm’s operations
        - Surveys of managers indicate that they spend a lot of time quantifying and managing financial risk
        - The increase in volatility of s/h returns as you need to pay back the interest/debt regardless of the environment
        - IT IS NOT DEFAULT RISK
- The effects are shown below:
    
    ![image.png](image%2045.png)
    
- Financial risk exists if debt is taken on which is also called financial leverage
- There are two ways to measure financial leverage:
    - Debt-to-equity ratio ($\frac{D}{E}$)
    - Debt-to-total-assets or debt-to-value ratio ($\frac{D}{D+E}$)
- Note that the total assets of a firm must equal the market value of debt plus equity
- So what's the impact of adding debt to the structure of the firm:
    - Expected rate of return on equity may increase
        - Any return created in excess of the interest cost of debt enhances shareholder returns
    - The variability of returns to shareholders increases
        - This is known as financial risk
    - Increasing leverage often involves a trade-off between risk and return
        - Risk-averse investors will demand higher return to take on higher risk
- Companies issue debt or equity, not only because they need to fund investment projects, but also because they want to alter their capital structure
- This suggests that managers believe that there is an optimal capital structure which maximizes the firm value
- The preference of source of capital and its rank is shown below:
    
    ![image.png](image%2046.png)
    

## The impact of financial leverage on firm value: Theoretical insights

- To have a theoretical model we assume that the following hold in the market:
    - capital markets are perfect
    - Firms and investors can trade the same set of securities at competitive market prices
    - There are no taxes, transaction costs or issuance costs
    - Firms have a fixed investment policy, and their investment decisions are not affected by their financing decisions
    - We also assume perpetual cash flows (earnings) to simplify the analysis
- When replacing debt with equity we have:
    
    ![image.png](image%2047.png)
    
    ![image.png](image%2048.png)
    
- The overall effects of borrowing funds and taking on financial leverage are...
    - Adding financial risk on top of business risk via increased variability in both EPS and ROE
    - Magnifying the effects on shareholder profitability (EPS and ROE) in good and bad economic circumstances
- The higher shareholder profitability comes at the cost of increased risk (financial risk) that shareholders face when the company takes on leverage
- The breakeven level of EBIT (EBIT*) occurs where the two capital structures result in the same EPS
    - At this breakeven point, the ROA is such that it is the interest rate paid on the company’s debt
    - When the ROA > interest, the company earns more on its assets than it pays on its debt and its EPS is higher than in the 100% equity case
    - When the ROA < interest, the company earns less on its assets than it pays on its debt and its EPS is lower than in the 100% equity case
- Does taking on financial leverage increase the company’s share price?
    - It depends on the increase in the expected EPS relative to the increase in the required rate of return shareholders use to discount these earnings
    - Remember that all earnings are paid out as dividends and the earnings are perpetual
    - So there is no change in the share price
- So that capital structure is irrelevant in terms of the market value of the firms assets

## The impact of financial leverage on firm value: Empirical evidence

- Theoretically, it can be shown that under a set of restrictive assumptions that the capital structure decision should have no impact on firm value
- Evidence suggests that firms behave as if capital structure is relevant:
    - Target ratios exist
    - Debt levels cluster at industry and firm size levels
- Share prices also react strongly to information about debt levels
- Firms seem to adjust debt levels in response to changing cost of debt

## Corporate taxes and financial leverage

- Corporate taxes result in a clear advantage to having debt in the capital structure as interest payments on debt are tax deductible
- There is a tax savings (or tax shield) associated with having debt in the capital structure
- There is no tax advantage related to dividends paid to shareholders
- We still assume capital markets are perfect:
    - Firms and investors can trade the same set of securities at competitive market prices
    - There are no transaction costs or issuance costs
    - Firms have a fixed investment policy, and their investment decisions are not affected by their financing decisions
    - We also assume perpetual cash flows (earnings)

# Topic 10: Capital structure and Payout Policy II

## Examine various payout policies of firms

### Traditional Payout policy

- Free cash flow is left over after investing in any positive NPV project
- Then there are two things to do with this free cash:
    - Pay out
    - Retain it
    
    ![image.png](image%2049.png)
    
    - There is a dotted line for investing in new projects because by definition free cash flow is the cash flow left after investing in all positive NPV projects so the projects being invested in is negative NPV, the reason for this is to build an empire and is associated with the agency costs of the management to make the company bigger
- There are two ways to distribute cash:
    - Dividends
    - Buy back shares
- There are different payout form:
    - Ordinary dividends: A regular dividend payment made by the firm
    - Special dividend: A one-time dividend payment made by a firm, which is usually much larger than its regular dividend
    - Share repurchase (or share buyback): A return of cash to shareholders via either an on-market or off-market repurchase of shares
    - Share split and bonus shares: A dividend paid in ordinary shares rather than as cash to shareholders
    - Liquidating dividend: A return of capital to shareholders from a business operation that is being terminated
- There are multiple important dates for a dividends:
    - Dividend declaration (or announcement) date
        - This is when the company announces the dividend amount
        - And it is when the information associated with the dividend is priced into the share price
            - Normally it allows investors to realign its expectations to the expectations of the management
        - Ex-dividend date
            - Typically, 1 – 2 business days before the record date so there is time for company records to be updated
            - If you purchase the shares before this date, you receive the announced dividend
            - On, or after, this date you do not receive the announced dividend
            - Normally the share price drops on that date, and it should drop by the price of the dividend
                - It drops because the share price no longer includes the dividend being paid, so it is worth less
        - Record date
            - The date by which shareholders need to be registered as the legal owners of the share in order to receive the dividend
        - Payment date
            - Date dividend is mailed or paid electronically
            - Share price shouldn’t change as the decreasing in cash is already priced in from the ex-dividend date
- When dividends are paid out investors are given an option to undertake the DRP (dividend reinvestment pack), it takes the dividends it would’ve received and gives it back to the company and the company will issue new equity to the investor in exchange for that equity
    - This is done normally at a discount to the market price
- Note that when dividends are announced earnings are also announced, so while dividends may have increased earnings may not have been as strong leading to a decrease in price
- For example, CBA is giving out dividends of $2.40 according to this schedule:
    
    ![image.png](image%2050.png)
    
    - The price movement of CBA over this period can be seen below:
        
        ![image.png](image%2051.png)
        
        - The difference between the first two red dots is due to the dividend announcement so it perceives it as positive and “higher then expected”
        - Then it falls between the thirds and fourth dot by $3.72 but it is greater than the dividend of $2.40, this is because the dividend is worth more than the $2.40 due to the tax implications which means the actual value of the dividend is $3.72

### Alternative Payout Policy

- There are multiple payout policies:
    - Pure residual dividend policy
        - Pay out any earnings that the firm does not need to reinvest
        - Dividends and dividend payout ratios tend to be unstable
    - Smoothed (or fixed) dividend policy
        - Target a proportion of earnings to be paid out as dividends
        - Objective here is for the dividends to equal the (long run) difference between expected earnings and expected capital expenditures
        - Stable dividends over time
    - Constant payout dividend policy
        - Pay a constant proportion of earnings as dividends
        - Stable dividend payout ratio but unstable dividend amounts
    - Low regular dividend and extra dividend policy
        - Normally paying low dividends over time and once in a while you pay a special dividends
        - The importance of this is that the market doesn’t expect it so if for some reason you cannot payout the expected dividend you share price would normally tank as it was expected to be paid out but with special dividends you don’t create an expectation of a reoccurrence of dividends
        - Firms do this so they use permanent earnings for dividends and temporary earning likes selling assets, one off transactions to pay out special dividends
- As can be seen above a lot of the policies aim to keep a somewhat similar amount of dividends, as the volatility/change in dividends are an illustrated a high level of risk to shareholders
- Looking at the graph below:
    
    ![image.png](image%2052.png)
    
    - Dividends are much smoother
    - This shows that there are two types of earning:
        - Permanent
            - Normal business earning
        - Temporary:
            - Temporary market conditions
    - then the company use dividends to return permanent earnings, while share buybacks are used to return temporary earnings

### Imputation Tax System

- From 1987 the payout ration increased for Australia compared to US, due to the tax system:
    
    ![image.png](image%2053.png)
    
- Under the imputation tax system, there are two important features:
    - Resident taxpayers pay tax on the pre-corporate tax income that gave rise to the dividend, rather than the dividend itself
        - This is known as the “grossed-up” dividend
        - It is calculated as:
            
            $$
            Div_{grossed-up} = \frac{Div_{cash}}{1-t_c}
            $$
            
    - Resident taxpayers receive a tax credit for the corporate tax already paid
        - Known as a franking credit or imputation credit
        - So:
            
            $$
            F.Credit = t_c \times Div_{grossed-up}
            $$
            
    - This gives the relationship:
        
        $$
        Franking \space Credit + Cash \space dividend = Grossed-up \space Dividend
        $$
        
- To illustrate the imputation tax system lets look at both systems for the following example:
    
    ![image.png](image%2054.png)
    
    - Classical Tax
        - Using clasical tax system each person recieves the following:
            
            ![image.png](image%2055.png)
            
        - The net effect of a classical tax system is that earnings are **double-taxed** at both the corporate and personal levels:
            - As $After-tax \space dividends = Earnings \space (on \space a \space per \space share \space basis) \times(1-t_c)\times(1-t_p)$
                
                ![image.png](image%2056.png)
                
    - Imputation Tax System
        - Now both receive:
            
            ![image.png](image%2057.png)
            
        - The net effect of an imputation tax system is that earnings paid out as dividends are taxed only once at the shareholder’s marginal rate:
            - As $After-tax \space dividends = Earnings \space (on \space a \space per \space share \space basis) \times(1-t_p)$
                
                ![image.png](image%2058.png)
                
- The franking credit is only applied to resident tax payers
- The things to note is that corporate tax still matters as:
    - If dividends receivers are non resident it gets taxed on that rate
    - If the company doesn’t pay out all of its earning it gets taxed on that rate
    - and it basically gives an interest free loan on the amount retained to the government until it pays it out as dividends

## Examine bonus shares and share splits

### Bonus Share

- Bonus shares (or share dividends) are payments made to existing shareholders where the dividend takes the form of new shares issued
- Note that there is not cashflow affect as it isn’t receiving cash or paying it, it just keeps the dividends and issues new shares and the market cap is the same
- The price per share changes by a factor of $\frac{1}{change \space in \space supply}$
    - So if number of shares increased by 20% the price per share would change by: $\frac{1}{1.2}$

### Share split:

- Share splits affect a company’s shares in a similar way to share dividends. When a company conducts a share split, its share price declines because the number of outstanding shares increases
- A 2-for-1 share split means that for every 1 share owned you own 2 shares after the split
- A 5-for-1 share split means that for every 1 share owned you own 5 shares after the split
- The price per share changes by a factor of $\frac{1}{change \space in \space supply}$
    - So if there was a 2 for 1 split the price per share would change by: $\frac{1}{2}$
- The reason for share splits is to keep the price per share down so that people are more willing to hold on to shares that are smaller in price

### Reverse Share Splits

- Reverse share splits are the opposite of share splits where the number of shares outstanding decreases, and the share price rises as a result of a consolidation of shares
- Typically companies do this when share prices drops a lot and does this to increase the share price

## Examine the factors affecting dividend and share repurchase decisions

- In Australia there are two methods of repurchasing shares
    - Off-market buyback
        - Personally contacts shareholders to buy
        - More tax advantaged as part of the proceeds can be seen as dividends
    - On-market buyback
        - Enter the market like any other buyer
    - Buybacks in Australia have traditionally been a tax-advantaged method of distributing cash
- Positive signal as they think the share is worth more than the current market price
- It is assumed that it commonly boost EPS as number of shares decreases
    - But earnings should also decreases in proportion as you take a portion of earnings
    - So it shouldn’t really change
    - However, EPS **only increases** if the cash is generated to fund the share buyback is from excess cash which means earnings is unaffected, but that will have the same affect as not doing a buy back
- Which is why share buybacks are used to return temporary earnings
- Sticky dividends:
    - This is when dividends only increase if the company believes it can maintain that amount of dividends, to manage expectations
    - But due to the difference in EPS and DPS we don’t pass on tax credits so its an interest free loan to the government so there are two options:
        - Issue special dividends
        - Share buybacks

## Does payout policy affect firm value? An overview of theory and practice

- To illustrate how payout policy doesn’t affects firm value, so the wealth of a shareholder is unaffected by the payout policy, we will use an example:
    
    ![image.png](image%2059.png)
    
    - The firms total market value:
        
        ![image.png](image%2060.png)
        
    - Policy 1: Pay dividends with excess cash:
        - The firm’s cum-dividend price is the price including the current period’s dividend, that is:
            
            ![image.png](image%2061.png)
            
        - After the ex-dividend date, the new shareholders will not receive the current dividend so the firm’s share price will fall to:
            
            ![image.png](image%2062.png)
            
        - So the original shareholders receive $2.00 dividend, and their shares are now worth $40.00 so their wealth **does not change**
    - Policy 2: Repurchase shares and pay no dividend:
        
        ![image.png](image%2063.png)
        
        ![image.png](image%2064.png)
        
    - Policy 3: Pay a higher dividend and issue new equity:
        
        ![image.png](image%2065.png)
        
        ![image.png](image%2066.png)
        
- So overall:
    
    ![image.png](image%2067.png)
    

# Topic 11: An Introduction to Options

## An overview of options markets

- A derivatives contract is a financial instrument whose value derives from that of an underlying asset
- Two broad categories of derivatives are
    - Forward and futures contracts
    - Option contracts
- Derivatives are traded over-the-counter (OTC) and on exchanges
    - OTC -dealers and brokers trade directly with each other via computer network/telephone
    - Exchange – all trading is via a centralised platform
- Derivatives markets are made up of arbitragers, speculators and hedgers:
    - An arbitrager is someone who attempts to make a profit from (typically temporary) differences in prices between derivative contracts and their underlying securities with **zero risk**
    - Speculators:
        - Has no pre-existing exposure in the underlying
        - They also have no direct interest in the underlying security
        - They trade as they speculate the direction
        - They take on risk, similar to gambling
    - A hedger has an existing exposure to an underlying security (or product) and wishes to minimize or eliminate this exposure
        - Has a pre-existing exposure and minimises this exposure through options
        - A portfolio manager concerned about a significant drop in the market
        - A jeweller with an exposure to the price of gold
        - A floating-rate borrower with an exposure to an increase in the interest rate

### Options Basics

- Options give the holder **the right, but not the obligation**, to **buy** or **sell** an asset at a **predetermined exercise price** at some time in the future
    - A call option gives the holder the right to buy
    - A put option gives the holder the right to sell
- You can buy or sell an option:
    - A bought position means that you hold or own the option and have the right to exercise it
    - A sold position means that someone else has the right to exercise it against you
        - You have a **contingent liability**
        - In return for selling the option you are **paid** a **premium**
            - It is called a premium as it is the price you pay/receive for hedging/being insured
- So:
    - You can buy the right to buy
    - You can sell the right to buy
    - You can buy the right to sell
    - You can sell the right to sell
- Market convention uses Long and Short to distinguish:
    
    ![image.png](image%2068.png)
    
- Call Example:
    - It is 1/1/2024
    - Judy is CFO of a breakfast cereal company that is exposed to the price of corn on March 31
    - Judy wants to put a $9 cap on the price that her company pays for corn
    - She does this by buying a call option with an exercise price of $9
    - The payoff diagram for this call:
        
        ![image.png](image%2069.png)
        
    - So this causes the price paid for corn to be the following, as the call option caps the price paid
        
        ![image.png](image%2070.png)
        
- Put Example:
    - Frank is a corn farmer who is also exposed to the price of corn on March 31
    - Frank wants to put a $5 floor on the price that he receives for his corn
    - He does this by buying a put option with an exercise price of $5
        - The payoff diagram for this put:
            
            ![image.png](image%2071.png)
            
        - So this causes the price Frank will receive  for corn to be the following, as the put option puts a lower bound on the price received
            
            ![image.png](image%2072.png)
            

## Option profits versus payoffs

- Currently the diagrams are payoffs at expiry
- We haven’t accounted for the price (or premium) paid for the option in the first place
- So there are two types of diagrams for options:
    - Payoff diagrams:
        - Only plots the payoff made from the option’s intrinsic value itself not including the premium paid/received vs the spot price
    - Profit diagram
        - Plots the profit made from the option as a whole including the premium price paid/received vs the spot price
- So below are examples of profit diagrams for call and puts:
    - If you pay $0.5 for the call option with a $9 strike price:
        
        ![image.png](image%2073.png)
        
    - If you pay $0.3 for the put option with a $9 strike price:
        
        ![image.png](image%2074.png)
        
- Note that for a long call or put option the person will sell their option at expiry whenever the spot price goes above or below the strike price respectively, this is because even though they may lose money due to the profit made being less than the premium paid it is at least less loss than not undertaking the contract

## Intrinsic value, time value and total value of an option

- The intrinsic value of an option is the **payoff from the option if it were to expire immediately**
    - Also referred to as the moneyness of an option
- So for a call option expiring at time T we have:
    
    $$
    𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓 \space 𝑎𝑡 \space 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑖𝑟𝑦 = Max(𝑆_𝑇− 𝑋, 0) \\ 
    𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑐 \space 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 = 𝑀𝑎𝑥(𝑆_{𝑁𝑜𝑤} − 𝑋, 0)
    $$
    
- So for a put option expiring at time T we have:
    
    $$
    𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑜𝑓𝑓 \space 𝑎𝑡 \space 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑖𝑟𝑦 = Max(𝑋-𝑆_𝑇, 0) \\ 
    𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑐 \space 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 = 𝑀𝑎𝑥(𝑋-𝑆_{𝑁𝑜𝑤}, 0)
    $$
    
- So this means that for different prices of the spot we have different intrinsic value:
    
    ![image.png](image%2075.png)
    
- An option’s “moneyness” refers to the value of the asset relative to the exercise price:
    
    ![image.png](image%2076.png)
    
- So we have three types of value associated with an option:
    - Total value:
        - The total value (or just value) of an option.
        - The price the option would sell for in a competitive market.
    - Intrinsic value:
        - The payoff if the option were to expire immediately.
        - Reflects the option’s moneyness
    - Time value:
        - The difference between total value and intrinsic value
        - Linked to the possibility that the option’s payoff might be even greater than it’s current intrinsic value
        - It is basically value of the uncertainty is may go from OTM to ITM or even deeper ITM
- So graphing it out for a long call option we get:
    
    ![image.png](image%2077.png)
    
    - Time value is max when the option is ATM, as there is more uncertainty in the movement of the spot
    - The time value decreases as you go more deep ITM or OTM as there is less uncertainty in where/how the underlying will move
- There are two types of options:
    - European style
        - Can only be exercised by the option holder at expiry
    - American style
        - Can be exercised at any time up to and including expiry
- So we can concluded:
    
    ![image.png](image%2078.png)
    
- Provided there is some state of the world where it might be optimal to exercise an American style option early, it will be worth more than the European counterpart
- So you don’t exercise an American call early for any reason as you could rather sell the option to also profit from the time value rather than just the intrinsic value from exercising the option
- But the only reason you exercise an American calls option is if the underlying is about to receive dividends which will cause the share price to drop and thus the value of the option will fall, but unlike a shareholder you aren’t compensated for the dividend itself so it may make sense to exercise the option to pocket the dividend
- On the other hand – put options involve receiving cash early
- By not exercising you are incurring an opportunity cost associated with being able to generate a return from the proceeds received
- It makes sense to exercise American style put options if they are deep in the money as the value of the option will only be just the intrinsic value and no time value as it is very deep ITM
- Speculators are attracted to derivative markets because of the opportunities for higher gains through advantageous price movements
    - Also higher losses through adverse price movements

## Drivers of Option Values

- There are six drivers of the value of an option:
    - Exercise price of the option
    - Value of the underlying asset (Delta)
    - Interest rate (rho)
    - Dividends over the life of the option
    - Volatility of prices for the asset (vega)
    - Term to expiry of the option. (theta)
- Exercise Price/Strike Price:
    - Call Options: Negative Relationship
        - As exercise price increases you have the right to pay more for the asset and the option becomes cheaper
        - As the right to pay $10 is less valuable than the right to pay at $6 a bushel
    - Put Options: Positive Relationship
        - As exercise price increases you have the right to receive more for the asset and the option becomes more expensive
        - As the right to receive $10 is more valuable than the right to receive $6 a bushel
- Value of the underlying asset:
    - Call Options: Positive Relationship
        - As the asset becomes more valuable the right to purchase at a fixed price becomes more expensive
    - Put Options: Negative Relationship
        - As the asset becomes more valuable the right to sell at a fixed price becomes cheaper
- Interest Rates:
    - Call Options: Positive Relationship
        - A call option involves a possible future cash outflow
        - The present value of this cash **outflow decreases** with increases in interest rates – which increases the value of the option
    - Put Options: Negative Relationship
        - A put option involves a possible future cash inflow
        - The present value of this cash inflow decreases with increases in interest rates – which decreases the value of the option
- Dividends
    - Call Options: Negative Relationship
        - When an asset goes “ex-dividend” the asset’s value declines by the dividend amount
        - This decreases the intrinsic value of a call option.
    - Put Options: Positive Relationship
        - A decline in the value of the asset – on the ex-dividend date – increases the value of a put option
- Volatility of prices for the asset
    - Call Options: Positive Relationship
    - Put Options: Positive Relationship
    - This makes sense as the more uncertain I am about outcomes, the more valuable insurance is making options also more valuable as they are a type of insurance
    - or in another way: as downside is capped at 0, but upside is uncapped, the more volatile it is, the greater the value
        - The chance of more extreme outcomes are higher
        - You benefit from an advantageous price movement than suffer from an adverse movement
        
        ![image.png](image%2079.png)
        
- Term to expiry of the option:
    - Call Options: Positive Relationship
    - Put Options: Positive Relationship
    - This makes sense as the more time to expiry, the greater the opportunity for the asset price to move in your favour by an even greater amount
        - While this means that the option may become even more OTM it doesn’t matter as your downside is capped as 0 plus there still is a chance it will become ITM
    - So basically it is the asymmetric nature of the payoff of the options that lead to this argument
    
    ![image.png](image%2080.png)
    
- So overall:
    
    ![image.png](image%2081.png)
    
    -
